The first event took place in Monaco and the 2nd in Khiva, Uzbekistan. The pools featured 4-game matches to produce a winner, with the winners of each pool then playing a 6-game match, in Chongqing, China, to decide who challenges Ju Wenjun for the Women's World Championship title. The top prize in the event is \u20ac60,000 euros. \n\n The final will take place March 29-April 4. It will be a six-game match between GM **Lei Tingjie** (who beat Mariya Muzychuk and Anna Muzychuk) and **Tan Zhongyi** (who beat Katernya Lagno and Alexendra Goryachkina).\n\n# Players\n\n|**#**|**Title**|**Name**|**Points**|**FED**|**Elo**|**Age**|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|1|GM|**Lei Tingjie**|0|\ud83c\udde8\ud83c\uddf3 CHN|2545|26|\n|2|GM| **Tan Zhongyi**|1|\ud83c\udde8\ud83c\uddf3 CHN|2526|31|\n\n# Games And Schedule:\n\n|\\#|White|Result|Black|Schedule|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|1|Tan Zhongyi|1-0|Lei Tingjie|29 Mar 7 am UTC|\n|2|Lei Tingjie|\\-|Tan Zhongyi |30 Mar 7 am UTC|\n|3|Tan Zhongyi |\\-|Lei Tingjie|31 Mar 7 am UTC|\n|4|Lei Tingjie|\\-|Tan Zhongyi |2 Apr 7 am UTC|\n|5|Tan Zhongyi |\\-|Lei Tingjie|3 Apr 7 am UTC|\n|6|Lei Tingjie|\\-|Tan Zhongyi |4 Apr 7 am UTC|\n\n#  Live Coverage\n\n* The official live broadcast is available on the Fide [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=Fide+Chess) and [Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/fide_chess) channels, with commentary from GM Alik Gershon and WIM Qiu Mengjie.", "score": 2}, {"text": "Event: New Delhi Fide Women's Grand Prix. #  [Official Website](https://womengrandprix.fide.com/)\n\n Follow the games here: [Chess.com](https://www.chess.com/events/2022-2023-fide-womens-grand-prix-third-leg) |  [Chess24](https://chess24.com/en/watch/live-tournaments/fide-womens-grand-prix-2022-2023-new-delhi/#live) |  [Lichess](https://lichess.org/broadcast/fide-womens-grand-prix-34/round-3/EBFFAIj9) |  [Chessbomb](https://nxt.chessbomb.com/events/2022-2023-fide-womens-grand-prix-third-leg)\n\n## Description\n\nThe New Delhi FIDE Women's Grand Prix is a 12-player round-robin taking place in New Delhi, from March 25 to April 5 2023.

Long post ahead, feel free to skip to the interesting parts or read it all the way through :)\n\n#My background\nI started playing chess at the beginning of COVID, just like many others. I never really studied it actively but I was fortunate enough to have a fairly good intuition, I reached 2000 Lichess rapid in just two years after starting. By never really studying I actually mean it, I've studied basically no endgames at all, completed an embarrassingly low number of puzzles and have a worse puzzle rush score than some 1600s. The only real studying I've done is openings, and only those that I play actively while trying to avoid main lines. \n\nI had never played anything longer than 10+0 online before joining my local chess club this January and participating in their 5+0 OTB Blitz nights. After getting to know some people there they really opened my eyes to how I'm actually not that terrible and encouraged me to play my first rated tournament. Which I did, early this month. It was a rapid tournament (rapid and classical affect the same national rating in my country) and I did quite well, scoring 3/5 points (and almost held a draw against a master, I was an exchange up for a pawn but time pressure caught to me since, as I said, I know no endgames at all). I got a rating of near 1800, which made me want to play more rated tournaments.\n\n#The tournament &amp; its format\n\nI heard of the tournament super late, only joined it two days prior, so I had no real time to prepare. The tournament consisted of four games over the weekend, time control being 90 minutes for the first 40 moves + 30 minutes after, with a 30 second increment starting from move 1. The pairings were based on a weird system where your rating \"changes\" after every round and your new opponent is the one closes to your changing Elo. I don't know if this system has any name in English, please do tell if it exists! This system basically guarantees that I don't have any impossible games but no free games at the same time. Finishing with 0 or 4 points would be very much a possibility.\n\n#Preparing for the tournament\n\nMy biggest concern when it comes to preparing for the tournament was the gaping holes in my opening knowledge. Since I've only played Blitz, a large amount of my opening knowledge consisted of tricky but objectively questionable lines that I was sure would get punished in classical play. Biggest concern of them all being my white repertoire against the Sicilian, I never learned any main lines and only played the Grand Prix with Nc3 and f4. I tried preparing some more solid but less theory heavy responses before the tournament, those being the Rossolimo and the Moscow against 2. Nc6 and 2. d6 respectively. I know, I know, not the easiest openings to play, but I really wanted to avoid the Open Sicilians in classical against players who have played them for their whole lives. In hindsight, I should have looked at more variations of the Sicilian as well as some d4/c4 positions since I hate playing those as black.\n\n#The games\nAll the games in a lichess study: https://lichess.org/study/f600z6uE\n\n##Game 1, black:\n1. e4 e5\n2. Nf3 Nf6\n3. Nxe5 Nxe4 | At this point my opponent went onto a long think. Like 20 minutes. \n4. Qe2 Qe7 | I was very happy to see the Qe2 line. I have most of my prep there and while it's most challenging for black, it's much more exciting than the more usual d4 lines.\n5. Qxe4 d6\n6. d4 dxe5 | Spending a lot of time again here.\n7. Qxe5 Qxe5+ | An inaccurate move by my opponent, but also avoids a lot of the theory.\n8. dxe5 Nc6 | Again, my opponent thought for a long time. At this time I had more time than I started with while my opponent had probably spent half of his time.\n9. Bf4 Bf5\n10. c3 0-0-0 | c3 is the best move if you want to attempt to hold the pawn. \n11. Bb5 Nxe5! | I anticipated this move and had calculated this explosive tactical response.\n12. Bxe5 Rd5 |  My opponent could try to hold onto a pawn by playing Bxg7 next, but I was genuinely hoping to see it with how much activity it would give me.\n13. Bd4 Rxb5\n14. c4 Ra5 | My first mistake. I calculated Bb4+ for quite a while but I couldn't find a line I was happy with. The problem being that basically no matter what, my g7 pawn hangs in the end and I didn't really want that. I had a feeling that Ra5 was inaccurate but I didn't want to risk it.\n15. 0-0 Bd3\n16. Rc1 Bc5 | At this point my opponent only had like 5 minutes left while I had over an hour. I thought taking would be the only move as I felt like the g7 pawn was poisoned, so I was quite surprised when my opponent actually spent some minutes here.\n17. Bxg7 Rg8 | Apparently it wasn't poisoned after all. But still, I was happy with my position considering the massive time advantage and felt I had compensation for it. My bishops are very strong looking at the king and I'm preparing to double stack on the g-file.\n18. Bc3 Ra6\n19. Nd2 Rg6\n20. g3 h5 | Going all in on the attack, trying to abuse the fact that my opponent has very low time.\n21. b4 Bd6\n22. Nf3 Bxc4 | I got my pawn back, the attack isn't as strong as I'd hoped but at least I'm not down a pawn anymore.\n23. Ne5 Bxe5\n24. Bxe5 b4 | The wrong defense. I had totally underestimated the a-file weakness after a4\n25. a4 a6 | A terrible calculation mistake by me.\n26. axb5 axb5\n27. Ra7 Rc6 | Yeah, my blitz brain took over and I played this move in seconds. \n28. Ra8+ Black resigns.\n\n##Game 2, white:\n1. e4 d6 | I found my opponent's Lichess account before the game and he had played quite a bit of Alekhine's online, so I prepared some lines for that using OpeningTree. I was quite surprised when he played d6. \n2. d4 Nf6 | I had prepared a line that this could transpose into in the Alekhine's (e4 Nf6 e5 Nd5 d4 d6) but I couldn't attempt transposing since e5 dxe5 dxe5 Qxd1 would be terrible for white.\n3. Nc3 g6\n4. f4 Bg7 | Going for an Austrian Attack, the same thing that I usually play as white online.\n5. Nf3 0-0\n6. Bd3 c6 | I decided to play e5 here, since the last time I played against the Pirc OTB it ended in a disaster since I waited too long before playing e5.\n7. e5 dxe5\n8. fxe5 Nd5 | I didn't want to take here, figured that I would be happy if he takes on c3 regardless of the doubled pawns.\n9. 0-0 Nxc3\n10. bxc3 Nd7\n11. Bc4 b5 | Bc4 was a mistake, but I clearly had the right idea. I was thinking of Qe1, a very familiar idea to me with an open f-file from the Grand Prix Sicilian, but I wanted to pressure the f7 square first with Bc4.\n12. Bb3 Nb6\n13. Qe1 e6 | A mistake from my opponent. Bg5 really causes some issues, which I found\n14. Bg5 Qc7\n15. Qh4 Nd7 | Here I'm already completely winning. Apparently Bh6 is crushing, but I went for the more obvious idea.\n16. Be7 h6 | Here, I sighed of relief. I finally knew for sure that I was winning and could start focusing on converting. I wasn't quite sure if he could try to save his rook by playing Re8. I was going to play Ng5 but I hadn't quite finished my calculations so him giving up the exchange was a relief.\n17. Bxf8 Bxf8 | Apparently I shouldn't've taken the rook even, but I don't count that as a mistake. \n18. Nd2 c5 | This move was so annoying. I can't take, I can't push c4. If I play a3 my bishop will get jailed for a very long time. I actually calculated Bxe6 but didn't see the Qe4 follow-up so I couldn't go for it (I was rooking at crazy Bxe6 fxe6 Rxf8 ideas). \n19. a3 c4 | And boom, most of my advantage is gone! But that's fine, I am still up an exchange and I was planning on converting this in the endgame anyway. \n20. Ba2 Bb7 | Another annoying move, going for the battery towards g2.\n21. Rf2 Qc6\n22. Qg3 Be7 | And here it all went to shit. Funnily enough, my next move is even Stockfish's choice on low depth, but once it runs for a while, it realizes the terrible tactical issue with it. It's a double attack and I figured it's winning on the spot. Even my opponent didn't see it originally when he played his previous move, he admitted after the game.\n23. Qf4 Bg5 | That can't work, right? Qxf7 is completely crushing...\n24. Qxf7 Kh8 | ...or is it? I'm losing back the exchange here, am I not? Nf3 doesn't work, Rf2 doesn't work, Qxg6 doesn't work, Re1 doesn't work, but, wait a minute! Re2 saves the day! Re2 Be3 Kh1! and Rf8 Qxg6 Rg8 Qe4!! blocking the attack and either black trades the queens or I do on the next move!\n25. Re2 Rf8\n26. Qxg6 Rg8 | As I played my next move, I left the table. When I came back, my opponent was still thinking, and my heart sank as I immediately saw the move that I had previously missed. And just seconds later, my opponent played it.\n27. Qe4 Qb6 | No way, he just slides his queen to the side with a DA on my queen. I can't block it with d5 since my d4 pawn is pinned by the queen. And my queen is trapped. The only safe square is g4 which loses to Be3. I threw it.\n28. Nxc4 bxc4 | The only real possibility\n29. Rb1 Bxe4\n30. Rxb6 Nxb6\n31. Rxe4 Bd2\n32. Rh4 Kg7\n33. Rh3 Rx8\n34. Rg3+ Kh7\n35. Rf3 Rc7\n36. Kf2 Nd5\n37. Bxc4 Rxc4\n38. Rf7+ Kg6\n39. Rxa7 Bxc3\n40. Ra6 Bxd4+ White resigns\n\nI can't believe I managed to lose this game. I'm completely demoralized after losing my first two games.\n\n##Game 3, white:\n1. e4 c5\n2. Nf3 e6 | And I'm out of prep already. I can't play the Rossolimo or Moscow against e6. What a terrible start.\n3. d4 cxd4\n4. Nxd4 a6 | And here I'm actually out of prep. I didn't even know this variation has a name, that's how out of touch I am with mainline Sicilians. \n5. Nc3 Qc7\n6. Be3 Bb4 | I tried to play the only things I know about the Sicilian, against the Najdorf you play Be3 so I figured it shouldn't be a bad move here either, I've heard people say that in many Sicilian starting positions there are quite literally dozens of playable moves for white. After Bb4 I already kind of regretted it.\n7. Qd3 Nf6\n8. f3 d5\n9. exd5 Nxd5 | Didn't see a real choice other than to take. Now I already have to bring my bishop back. What a terrible opening failure. \n10. Bd2 Nxc3\n11. Bxc3 Bxc3+\n12. Qxc3 Qxc3+ | I figured that if I wanted to have any chance, I should just trade things off and defend the endgame. Not sure if it was the best practical option in hindsight but Stockfish doesn't hate me for it at least \u00b4.\n13. bxc3 e5\n14. Nb3 0-0 | This I thought was inaccurate by my opponent, most of the pieces have been traded off so why castle? Your king will have to join the fight soon enough and it's not like I can attack it.\n15. Bd3 Be6 | Another weird move. I was actually kind of liking my chances at this point. I still had the feeling that Stockfish would show something stupid like -2 since my pawns are terrible, but I felt like the next move gave me quite a nice position. And it's actually pretty good in reality too.\n16. Nc5 Bd5\n17. c4 Bc6\n18. Rb1 Ra7 | What an ugly move Ra7 is. I was quite happy with my chances, finally, I felt like the game was finally back to a 3 result game. \n19. Kf2 Rc8\n20. Rhe1 f6 | Here apparently I'm winning after Bf5. I considered it, but decided against it.\n21. Ne4 Bxe4 | Should take back with the bishop since Rxc4 loses to Bd5. I missed that.\n22. Rxe4 Nc6\n23. c3 Rc7 | c3 not the most accurate move, but it's restricting the knight and giving my bishop some air. \n24. g4 Ra8\n25. Re3 Rd8\n26. Ke2 Na5 \n27. Bf5 Kf7 | And here's where things started to go wrong. \n28. Rb6 Kf8 | Luckily my opponent didn't punish my mistake by playing Rd2+. It's not easy to spot but quite devastating.\n29. Be6 Rc6 \n30. Rxc6 Nxc6 \n31. Bd5 Ke7\n32. Rd3 Rc8 | I thought this Rd3 move was a huge mistake by me since the rook can't defend the c4 pawn anymore, which becomes apparent in a few moves. It's not bad in reality though.\n33. Kd2 Na5\n34. Kc2 Rc7\n35. h4 Nxc4 | Losing the pawn, yay! But maybe I can hold the endgame.\n36. Bxc4 Rxc4 | I shouldn't have traded. Now I'm gone from -1,5 to -5. The engine sees that the endgame is not holdable but humans aren't engines, luckily.\n37. Kb3 b5\n38. Re3 h6 | I thought that if we traded rooks I could maybe hold the endgame, but as I said, I'm terrible at them. We both still had plenty of time so I was confident in my calculation though. But it's still losing.\n39. Re4 Rc6 | Apparently my opponent agreed with me.\n40. a4 Kd6 | Another miscalculation, I thought if we traded all the queenside pawns and the rooks it would be a draw. So that's what I went for.\n41. axb5 axb5\n42. c4 bxc4+\n43. Rxc4 Rxc4\n44. Kxc4 Kc6 | I had realized that if my opponent just goes Ke6 here it's over, but he wanted opposition. Here, again, I thought this was for sure a draw.\n45. h5 Kd6\n46. Kd3 Kd5\n47. Ke3 Ke6 | Black can't keep the opposition anymore. There's still some win for the engine but for an intermediate player it's really not obvious.\n48. Ke4 Ke7 | At this point I thought for a long time, and this is probably the most embarrassing moment of this game. I thought that if I play Kf5 Kf7 I lose because I have to go Ke4 back but here I would have f4. I just played it a move too early.\n49. f4 exf4 | The final mistake of the game.\n50. Kxf4 Kf7\n51. Kf5 Draw agreed.\n\n##Game 4, black:\n1. Nf3 d5 | I was surprised to see 1. Nf3, my opponent was quite young and usually younger players like e4 openings more\n2. e3 Nf6\n3. c5 Bf5 | Yeah, I don't know what to do against a R\u00e9ti type of opening. A mistake on move 3 already.\n4. cdx5 Qxd5 | He thought for a while before playing this, and I realized I can't even take back with the knight because of e4 Qa4+\n5. Nc3 Qd8\n6. d4 e6\n7. Qb3 Qc8 | Already my position is terrible, lovely.\n8. Be2 c5\n9. 0-0 cxd4 | I don't know what I was thinking, what a terrible move by me.\n10. Nxd4 Be7\n11. Bf3 Nc6 | Here you can really see the difference between speed chess and classical. In speed chess basically everyone would have taken on f5 and damaged my pawn structure, but in classical you can play more accurately.\n12. Qa4 0-0 | I'm losing a pawn by force, have to just cut my losses.\n13. Nxc6 bxc6 | Inaccurate by him, I'm almost completely fine now.\n14. Bxc6 Rb8\n15. Bf3 Bd3 | A nice find by me, that bishop won't be easy to remove from d3.\n16. Rd1 Rd8\n17. Qc6 Qxc6 | He doesn't take the pawn I offered, now I'm basically equalized. But it will still take work to prove it.\n18. Bxc6 Ng4 | I'm proud of this move, really stepping on the gas here by getting my knight onto the e5 square.\n19. e4 Ne5? | A missed opportunity here, apparently Bc5 is very strong. I definitely should have seen that, but I played Ne5 quite swiftly without much thought.\n20. Ba4 Nc4 | Here I thought he couldn't play b3 due to Bf6 and if he played Bb3 I could force a draw with Na5 Nc4 repetition.\n21. b3 Bf6 | A very strong tactical move.\n22. Bf4 Rc8\n23. e5 Nxe5 | Here I'm apparently completely winning\n24. Rac1 Ng4 | Here I offered him a draw and after thinking for a while he accepted it. In hindsight I could have definitely pushed on further but it was getting late and even if I got a full point I wouldn't have been anywhere near getting any prizes since I only had half a point from the first three games.

It's like trying a sampling plate at a restaurant or sampling at a winery/brewery. I just get a taste, and if I like it then I can try it again sometime in the future. Even if I don't play it again, I get familiar with a new pawn structure, new ideas, and sometimes (unfortunately) new opening tricks that I can use or avoid. Sometimes, for aggressive openings or gambits, they also lead to crazy tactical positions that I otherwise would rarely encounter. \n\nPlus, most of the people in these tournaments are also just learning the opening, so you are at the same disadvantage and figuring out the same things as everyone else. (This isn't the case with every opponent, of course, but it's more often the case then not imho.) \n\nLast point: I also like that on Halloween, they do the Frankenstein-Dracula Variation.

Just don't have time to do it this evening.**\n\n**edit2: Here's the PGNs! Adding them one at a time, since I may run out of time before I have to leave the house.**\n\n**Game 1:** [Chess Analysis Board and PGN Editor - Chess.com](https://www.chess.com/analysis/game/pgn/2bvso3ghvW?tab=analysis)   \n(Pretty much how I described it!) \n\n**Game 2:**  [Chess Analysis Board and PGN Editor - Chess.com](https://www.chess.com/analysis/game/pgn/4caZc2vH8i?tab=analysis)  \n(I chickened out of trading both rooks for the queen and a pawn, but I let my advantage slip many more times than I realized! I was in serious time pressure and thought my Rook sacrifice led to a perpetual. Simply did not see Ke8, sad all day. Also important: This kid's name was Evan.)\n\n**Game 3:**  [Chess Analysis Board and PGN Editor - Chess.com](https://www.chess.com/analysis/game/pgn/MBJswu614?tab=analysis)   \n(Embarrassingly bad opening. Need to study! I did AWFUL, and my opponent missed an opportunity to win a piece. I continued to be worse even while I thought I had a huge attack, and my precision was not nearly as good as I thought it was, but I did find the best move in a couple of key spots, including the game-winning Qd5 for the deflection sacrifice.) \n\n*note: G60 3-round Quads format with my being the top seed, rated \\~1350 after a couple of terrible tournaments tanking me down from nearly 1600.*\n\nIn Game 1, I faced a Russian teenager named Alex, rated a bit below me. I was fifteen minutes late to the table, but he generously only ran five minutes off my clock. I rewarded his kindness by taking a truly incredible amount of time on each of my moves.\n\nI played a main-line Giuoco Piano, which means 'quiet game' in Italian, but can actually quickly become an incredibly sharp position with tons of tactical opportunities. My opponent played quickly, perhaps hoping that my spending up to five minutes on some of my early moves would mean that he could beat me on the clock. I spent my time well, focusing on punishing my opponent's inaccuracies to achieve a suffocating position with enormous pent-up pressure, and at the right moment, I leveraged my advantages to win with a clean checkmate. I was never in danger.\n\nIn Game 2, I faced a young kid rated a bit lower than me. He played the Evan's Gambit, an old-school swashbuckling opening in which White sacrifices a pawn for a steamroller attack, and one wrong move can spell disaster. I played a little-known defensive line, taking my young opponent out of his preparation, and he struggled to justify his sacrifice across the remainder of the game.\n\nI shuffled my pieces well, then traded in my extra pawn for a winning end-game position--but I had used far too much of my time, and rather than trading down into a simpler position to fight it out with my obvious advantage, I dawdled, and my opponent was able to get a good attack going. Low on time, I tried to be a bit too fancy and missed an obvious move, costing me the game.\n\nIn Game 3, I faced a guy around my age or a bit older, named Tim, about the same rating as me. He played the Sicilian defense, in which Black tries to leverage an imbalanced position to outplay his opponent, rather than playing into symmetrical lines. I got a bit too fancy in the first few moves and found myself in a precarious position, and feared that I was simply getting too exhausted to play...\n\nBut then I noticed that for the cost of THREE PAWNS, I could point all of my pieces directly at my opponent's king, and very probably have an incredibly powerful attack. My opponent gleefully accepted my dubious sacrifice, and I got exactly what I wanted in return: Massive pressure on his King.\n\nOnce again, I used far more time than my opponent, calculating dangerous lines and trying to find the most precise way to justify my sacrifice. He moved too quickly, making a careless mistake, and suddenly all of my pieces were swarming his King. Only then did he start to really use his time, taking my threat seriously.\n\nHe defended well, creating powerful threats while keeping his King safe, always finding just the right move to create an attack on me while at the same time staving off my assault. No longer seeing my path forward, I looked at my clock: 3 minutes left, compared to my opponent's 40 minutes left! I sat patiently. I used two of my three remaining minutes, calculating. And then, I had an idea. With less than a minute left on my clock, I moved my Queen to an undefended square. My opponent assumed that, with no time left on my clock, I must have made a simple mistake. He happily took my Queen.\n\n... but by moving his Queen to take mine, he had given me the narrow window that I needed. I played instantly, forcing checkmate in three moves to win the game with 50 seconds left. My opponent was not happy about it.\n\nI ended the day with two wins and one loss, tying for first in my group, and won $40. Honestly the best chess I've played in ages. Even my loss was exciting and I felt like my wise use of time really put me head and shoulders above my opponents, save for a few obvious mistakes.", "score": 28}, {"text": "Why is this a blunder (Qc2 is the best move)?.

", "score": 2}, {"text": "Three Years of Chess: Progress Report. Hiya,\n\nThree years ago I decided I was going to try and learn to play chess well, from a starting point of pretty much zero.\n\nSince then I\u2019ve done 3 / 6 / 9 / 12 / 18 / 24 month updates. And now here we are three years in \u2013 and cracking 2000 on Lichess Rapid for the first time.\n\nhttps://imgur.io/5OviR0k\n\nI work a 9-5 and study part-time, early 30s. As always, many people progress faster but it\u2019s been fun to put together these posts and I hope it might help other adult improvers / add to the data out there.\n\nStarted chess: March 2020.\n\n**Blitz rating:** My lowest rating was ~800 and my current rating is ~1800. I\u2019ve played about 3,000 games of blitz. Over the past year I\u2019ve added 50 points to my blitz rating.\n\n**Rapid rating:** My lowest rating was ~1100 and my current rating is ~2000. I\u2019ve played about 1,000 games of rapid. Over the past year I\u2019ve added 150 points to my rapid rating.\n\n**Time spent playing on Lichess:** I have 40 days of playtime.\n\n**What I did in the past year:**\n\nI didn\u2019t change too much in the past year \u2013 I drilled a heap of tactics, I upped the volume of games I played, and a couple of months ago I joined an OTB club, which I think has already made a difference. Playing OTB is a much more \u2018pure\u2019 chess experience \u2013 you just have to sit there and play, and the physical nature of it helps you remember the games (and the lessons you learn) more effectively, I think. Plus it\u2019s lots of fun.\n\nI also switched from playing 15+10 to 10+0. I think this is meant to be a stronger player pool, but I found the games easier overall, or they suited me more. I think it helps to play aggressively / for complications and tactics in no increment, and that suited the positions I like to get. Plus, I could get more games in and losses were less tilting, even though the quality of the games overall was definitely diminished.\n\nIf I could choose three things that helped me improve overall - structured tactical training (i.e. progressively more difficult thematic puzzle books), analysis of your own games and watching strong players talk about their thought process as they play slow games.\n\n**Time spent by rating band:**\n\n1100 - 1200, 5 days.\n1200 - 1300, 55 days.\n1300 - 1400, 64 days.\n1400 - 1500, 29 days.\n1500 - 1600, 76 days.\n1600 - 1700, 77 days.\n1700 - 1800, 173 days.\n1800 - 1900, 531 days.\n1900 - 2000, 85 days.\n\nThis isn\u2019t the most useful metric .. it\u2019d probably be better to look at time spent in each rating band by number of games, I think, but it\u2019s still broadly interesting. I have no real idea why 1800 - 1900 took so much longer. 2022 was a big year for life stuff for me, but I didn\u2019t realise I spent so long there. I\u2019d be curious if others have hit a similar wall between 1700 - 1900.\n\n**Books read in order and % read:** Logical Chess Move By Move - Chernev (60%) &gt; Winning Chess Strategies - Seirawan (70%) &gt; The Amateur\u2019s Mind - Silman (5%) &gt; Endgame Manual - Silman (20%).\n\n**Chessable courses used in order:** Scotch Short and Sweet (completed) &gt; 100 Endgames You Must Know (completed the beginner section) &gt; Checkmate Patterns Manual (almost finished) &gt; 1001 Chess Exercises for Beginners (completed) &gt; 1001 Chess Exercises for Club Players (unfinished, working on it) &gt; Endgame Studies 101 (unfinished, working on it).\n\n**Other resources used:** I pretty much thought about chess in some way every single day. Really enjoyed being a part of this subreddit and getting lots of valuable advice here from others. I always watch John Bartholomew\u2019s videos and the chess fundamentals series is what got me started + Naroditsky\u2019s OG speedrun series. The ChessKing app Tactics for Beginners was the first thing I worked through. Recently I\u2019ve been watching a bit more of Chessfactor and the St Louis Chess Club lectures.\n\n**Repertoire:** I tried to play mainline everything, pretty much \u2026 I played e4 (Scotch), e4-e5, d4-d5. Can go into more detail if of interest. I never studied that much about the opening beyond looking through games on the analysis board afterwards to slowly build some knowledge, and still don\u2019t know what I\u2019m doing in openings a lot of the time // after about five moves.\n\n**Where to from here?** This has been a very enjoyable journey of chess improvement. It was also really, really tough at times. Some people seem to breeze to 2000 but for me, playing chess was often painful and disheartening, especially the countless times I blundered completely winning positions or lost rating after studying for months and doubted it was possible to go further. But I really wanted to prove to myself that I could do it and learn this new skill. My goal from the start was 2000 Rapid and I\u2019m really glad I got there.\n\nThat said, I still feel like a total scrub at chess. I\u2019m looking forward to building a proper opening repertoire for the first time and am reading Chess for Zebras as something a bit lighter and chess-adjacent. Also keen to go through some game collections and to play in some more OTB tournaments. I still feel like there\u2019s heaps to do and so many areas to improve (especially positional chess, endgames and openings) but I\u2019ll probably take it a bit easier over the next year or so.\n\nSee you for an update then!", "score": 91}, {"text": "I ran out of time as black and white won without sufficient material.

I have the subscription so I can review my games, and I genuinely have not had an opponent play under 1000 elo skill in the past 15 games or so (based on the [chess.com](https://chess.com) evaluation of each player's skill level for the game). For context, I am low 700, (started high 700 but I've been losing a lot so low now). Even games where it evaluates me at playing well above my elo, like 1000 or so, my opponent will be playing at 1150 level so I lose anyway.

Like I will spend thirty minutes studying the line for a not-so well known opening and then this random 750 player magically knows the correct sequence of moves for the opening and plays each move within like ten seconds of my play?

Accepting that instead of playing for checkmate, I will be playing for a winning endgame which I will hopefully be able to achieve through kingside pressure (which an IQP structure encourages). In the case of the Scandinavian this is rather easy to achieve and is basically forced due to the nature of the opening.

While it might appear obvious that you should think during your opponents turn, fast play turns this two-way advantage into a one-way advantage. \n\nSee if your opponent takes 20-30 seconds to make a move (I play 10 minute so bare with me), and during their turn you come up with counters against the moves your opponent is most likely to make, then when they finally make their move, you can immediately move. By doing so you have not only denied them the ability to think on your time but also force them to spend more time thinking on theirs'. This compounds further by allowing you to think for even longer on their time. \n\nThis doesn't even require a short time restraint, the eventual pressure your opponent is going to feel once they run into time trouble (long before you do) will make them prone to blundering.

Hi folks -- Small write up on how I managed to use probably my all time favorite chess board and piece theme that only exists on Lichess.org.\n\n**Subjective:** I am in love with the Maestro pieces + Olive board. It looks absolutely amazing on Lichess.org and switching back to Chess.com makes me puke. Its such a mess.\n\n**Preface:** I am doing this in Chrome, but you should be able to do this on Firefox (do not think we can \"easily\" do this, if at all on Mobile apps).\n\n**Background:**\n\n1. Both websites render the chess board and pieces - and everything such as arrows, labels, etc - using SVG HTML elements\n2. Both websites render pieces and board using static images\n3. Any web browser renders images by first fetching them (i.e: downloading them)\n\n**Overview**\n\nSince both sites are loading images from each from its respective URL, what we can do is intercept this and \"replace\" the image address with that of the corresponding Lichess image asset.\n\nMeaning, if Black Pawn is rendered on Chess.com from `www.chess.com/blackpawn.jpg` we can instead tell Chrome to replace that URL with `www.lichess.org/blackpawn.jpg`. This is also true vice versa (incase you want to render themes from Chess.com on Lichess.org)\n\nSubsequently, the piece you will see rendered will be that of the replaced image.\n\n**How I do this**\n\n1. Find all the image addresses for the board and all pieces for your current Chess.com theme\n2. Find all the image addresses for the board and all pieces for your current Lichess.org theme\n3. Use a \"Redirection\" Chrome extension (or something similar on Firefox). This is the [one I used](https://app.requestly.io/); [here](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/redirector/ocgpenflpmgnfapjedencafcfakcekcd) is an alternative. I am not affiliated in anyway with either.\n4. Configure the URL rules in the plugin by specifying source URL and target URL\n5. Refresh on Chess.com\n6. Here is example for doing this for one piece https://imgur.com/a/TTdeKxQ\n\n**Result**\n\nhttps://imgur.com/a/5WgojeH\n\n&gt; Redacted personal information out of fear and respect of the opponent\n\n\n**Notes(s)**  \n1. Since the source and destination URLs on both websites are specific to your piece setup, if you change your themes, you will need to find the new \"source\" and/or \"destination\" image URLs.  \n2. Both sites use good naming conventions (bn = black Knight) so once you know the structure of one URL for one piece, you can infer the rest and this process is little less painful.\n\n**Fair Play**\nUpdate: Adding this section since I think some people might have questions surrounding this.\n\nThis is a client side, cosmetic change and should not give you advantage over your opponent.
