Currently, I work from home and can go to the office whenever I feel like it. I guess it will be worth it in the long term.\n\n\n\nHello!\n\nBasically the title, and I need advice and other perspectives on this matter.\n\nFirstly, my background. I'm a junior Java dev at the largest and the most innovative bank in my country with ~1.5 YOE. My education is not technical at all, I've graduated a Java Spring bootcamp in 2021, after having worked at an Air Company for 2.5 years as a crew controller. At some point I've even became the supervisor and was managing the work of an operational team of 10+ people.\n\n Our team, which is a part of a division, which consists of 3 teams in total, has lost our team lead a couple of months ago (he is a senior dev that wanted to code, not manage people). And so the head of our division was temporarily acting as our team lead while he wad looking for replacement. Unfortunately, no one in our whole department wanted to take that role and finding someone from outside the company is problematic. It's not like our team has issues or something, it's just that there us nobody willing and qualified for this role. \n\nSo, today the head of our division approached me, telling about how it's been really hard for him to micromanage our team and macromanage whole division simultaneously. He simply does not have enough time and his human resource is finite. After that he told me that he needs someone to take on the team lead role within the team and he thinks that it should be me. That is because during my performance review last month, which went great and I have received almost a 100% salary raise, I told that I wouldn't mind improving not only my technical skills, but management skills as well.\n\nThe other guys from my team are all more experienced than me in software development field and all of them have the proper education, but he told me that none of them would want or would have the necessary skills to be the lead. I completely trust his judgment, as he is on of the coolest, most professional and skilled person I know, both technically and socially.\n\nThere was no pressure from him at all, he was genuinely exhausted and saw this offer as a possible solution. He still has to tell about this to the director of our department and gain his approval, so it isn't even guaranteed, but I have a feeling that the director will be willing to gamble on this as he is that type of person. I've been given time to think till Monday. \n\nSo, now I feel a bit overwhelmed and I honestly don't know what how I am going to respond. On one hand, this is possibly a great opportunity to grow and great experience to have. I also kinda enjoy being in charge, taking risks and responsibilities. On the other hand, I love being a software developer, I feel like I'm good at it and I like learning a lot. I'm afraid that I won't have enough time to code and will have to commit to being a manager. I also feel like I'm not good enough and experienced as a developer yet, and also I don't think I have gained much authority within the team and the company. \n\nI've been also told that at first I won't officially be a team lead for the first 6 months or so and probably won't have the full spectrum of responsibilities. Most likely I'm gonna manage some business processes and the tasks within the team, while also bring handheld a bit by the head of the division.

I am conflicted between a job offer at a new company (Company B) and the counter offer at my current company (Company A).\n\nA little backstory first. My family consists of my wife and myself, no kids and no plan for kids. I live 15 miles from both companies so the commute time is identical. I am a Software Engineer, currently using LabVIEW, TestStand, and a little C# at a small company. I have been there 1.5 years. I have the most experience out of my immediate coworkers (2 full time engineers and 2 co-ops), this means I end up leading most efforts, distributing tasks, and acting as a source of information. This also means I have little to no options if I need help, guidance or technical knowledge (my boss doesn't know LabVIEW or C#).\n\nI felt that I was being undervalued at my current job A, so I threw out my resume to a couple different places and ended up getting an offer for a 30% increase in salary at a very large company as a C++ Software Engineer.\n\nI have detailed the offers below. I really just need some outside perspective.\n\nCompany B:\n\n* 30% salary increase.\n* WFH 4 days per week.\n* Very good benefits.\n* 5 person (6 with me) team to work with.\n* Technically capable boss.\n* Guaranteed 3% annual bonus with annual cost of living raise.\n\nMy current company A gave me the following Counteroffer:\n\n* 40% increase in pay. ( I am fortunate enough that the 10% difference is not a big deal to me)\n* WFH 3 days per week, maybe more or less depending on current tasks.\n* Sub-par benefits. (I am currently covered through my wife's employer)\n* No team support, I'm mentoring 2 co-ops\n* No guaranteed annual raise/bonus.\n\nMy conflict comes from the following.\n\n1. Company A is department of defense and company B is a public company. I feel like I have more room to move and grow in a public company.\n2. I also feel that I have more flexibility in my future if I continue with C++ rather than continue with LabVIEW.\n3. While I enjoy (and apparently am decent at) the leadership role I was thrust into, it is exhausting trying to manage 4 people. I have a very small support system and not much time to dedicate to my own tasks.\n4. On the other hand since Company A has told me that they have a path forward and upward in the company for me.\n5. Also since I was given a counter offer it does mean they value my work.\n\nAnother point that bothers me is that Company A was so willing to offer a 40% raise when I talked about leaving but 1 week prior I was provided with a 4% raise and told \"we really appreciate what you do\".\n\nIt makes me feel like they will always under value me.\nI also fear that I won't get raises for a few years at Company A.\n\n\n\nIf you have made it this far, thank you so much.\n\nPlease give me any guidance, thoughts, or advice that you have.

It should be noted that I live in Spain and therefore the salaries I will be citing will seem very low for a USA employee.\n\nA brief summary about my experience: I have two years of experience as a data scientist creating predictive models using machine learning in a small company. I left that company for personal reasons, and then I could not find a job as a data scientist, so I ended up working as a data analyst. Also, I have a bachelor degree in Software Engineering and a master degree in AI.\n\nI am currently working as a Data Analyst for my current company. While the company I am working for is a very big international company, I work in a small team of 6 members. This job is very relaxed, I am free to estimate how much time my own tasks will take, and I am not pressured with deadlines. Also, I work completely from home, which is something I appreciate a lot. Some disadvantages of keeping this job is that I am getting paid 26 000\u20ac per year, which is low even for Spain. Also, this is not a job position I see myself doing in the future. Finally, there are practically zero promotion chances within this company.\n\nNow, recently I\u2019ve been given an offer to work in a smaller company that would pay me 31 000\u20ac per year, which is around a 20% increase. This would be a role as an AI Engineer, and I would be working in tasks like natural language processing, machine learning, and social robotics. It is clear to me that accepting this new job will be great for my career, as it will allow me to get back into the AI path, and the experience that I obtain in this job could help me find better jobs in the future.\n\nHowever, I will have to work in the office one of every two weeks. The office is in another city, and the commute would be about 1 hour by train. Also, the company is known for constantly firing employers without any warning. I consider myself a highly performing worker and I believe in my capacity of performing well enough to not get fired, but the fact that they are so careless about firing employees makes me believe that the work environment will be harsh, stressful and full of deadlines.\n\nIn conclusion\u2026 I think the salary increase is not enough to give up the full remote relaxed position at my current company, and I should instead stay and perhaps keep looking for better opportunities. Honestly, with my experience and education, I think I should be able to find a better job. However, I am afraid that I might regret this decision in the future and I should instead accept it and get the experience that could help me find better jobs in the future, at the cost of worse working conditions for the next one or two years.\n\nI only have two more days to think before giving my final decision.

I'm also under the impression that cybersecurity and \"Network and Information Security Specialization\" are both a lot of certifications and you have to redo your cert every couple of years, though I could be wrong. Additionally, from what I heard jobs that are more in line with \"Network and Information Security Specialization\" are essentially working at a school or company just being a helpdesk and don't have much room for an advancing career. Unfortunately, I really don't just want a helpdesk job as that doesn't interest me. I would greatly appreciate it if anyone can give me insight as to what jobs pertain to both of these majors as well as your opinion on working in whichever field (also what the job market is like in terms of having many or few jobs, type of work environments, etc).

I recently started a job about 8 months ago as a full stack developer. Before this, I worked as a cloud consultant for two years at a major cloud provider. To give a quick background to my situation, in my previous job my work was basically not technical (giving demos, presentations, etc). This always bothered me and I essentially spent that entire period doing leetcode and interviewing for a more tradition software dev role. After much rejection, I finally landed my current job which is a full stack developer (.NET) at a very small company on a team of 4 engineers (including a consultant who does not work for the company and a DBA). One thing to note as well as when I was brought on, I was the only junior engineer (today there is an additional junior engineer and then the rest are seniors).\n\nEverything was great here for the first 5 months. I really felt like I was learning a ton and growing as a software engineer - I found the work to be challenging and rewarding. But this has drastically changed over the past few months. For starters, my company was recently acquired so my boss (who is both one of the partners of the company and the sole software engineering manager) started to get pulled into a ton of different meetings about the acquisition and immediately starting giving less of his focus to the software engineering team. Now this wouldn't normally be a problem as much but my boss does not have a proper agile system with documented requirements in place. The way I had been getting my work assigned is by having meetings with my boss to discuss what changes need to happen where. This set up is also helpful because we use a framework that my boss developed in C# so he can point to me to what I should be using in the framework (there is also no documentation for this framework so it is nearly impossible for me to learn it on my own). We are also in a very niche industry (tax collections) so it can be difficult to set sure our requirements in line with the local legislators. Having consistent meetings to discuss requirements was the way around this, but now my boss never has time to go over things with me. I consistently tell my boss I need more work and he will say something along the lines of \"I have meetings with corporate all day, I will send out a meeting this afternoon\" but never does. There is no system in place for a consistent flow of work. This is not as much an issue for the senior level engineers who also understand the business side of things a lot more.\n\nRecently we hired another junior engineer to fill the roll of someone who left before I joined. I can tell right away that this person is also having similar issues. This person joined a few weeks back, and my boss has been so busy with the parent company (doing non technical stuff) that he has not had the time to even get this new person introduced to the company. Never even had that \"Welcome aboard, this is what we do\" meeting. So now, I am assuming once my boss can actually meet with one of us he will prioritize the new person (as he should). But I just have no idea what to do myself. I have been keeping busy with more IT support type tasks that involve no development just so that I don't go crazy of boredom. Before my boss left for the week (he is at this week because he has to go to a conference with the parent company), he mentioned something along the lines of I was going to join in on the \"Welcome to the company\" meetings with the new person which is bullshit. I have already done that. He is trying to lump me in on everything with this new employee of two weeks because he does not have the time to have work designated for each of us. I know we are both \"juniors\" but there is a huge different between 8 months and 2 weeks. He recently got us licenses too for a new reporting software we will be using which I find out there is also not coding involved. Just drag and drop.

Do I just take the paychecks and do nothing (not ideal as I am a junior engineer and want to learn skills and progress)?\n\nTLDR; my boss is super busy and never makes time for me.

If the contents read \"The junior software engineer will work with senior mentors...\" this job gets filtered out. I have tested this. While this filter does typically cut the results in half, some of my best interviews resulted from posts which would have been filtered out.

Now I want to help her fulfill her dream of coming back to the SWE industry.. I'm not a frequent poster on Reddit, but this is very important to me. My mom is one of the smartest people I know. Before I talk about her, I'll share a bit about myself. I was born in India but grew up in the United States. I've always loved computers, and hence computer science, thanks to my mom. I'm finishing my MS in CS and will be joining a FAANG+ company this summer. My brother was also born in India and raised in the US; he's a talented 10th grader with many more achievements than I had at that age. My brother and I owe a lot of our success to our mom. She sacrificed her career to become a full-time stay-at-home mom and always put our education first. She instilled in us a love for learning and computer science, which has led to our academic and professional achievements. Without her guidance and support, we wouldn't be where we are today. I want to help my mom achieve her dream of working in the computer science industry. \n\nMom was born and raised in India. For education, she earned a bachelor's degree in Physics (1987), a master's degree in Computer Science (1990), and worked on her Ph.D. in compiler design (1999). She was also a lecturer at a university in India. When she was trying to have kids, there were a lot of complications, and she had to move a lot for medical reasons to have me. By the time she had me, she had already lost so much that she was determined to always be there for me. So she quit her job and became a full-time stay-at-home mom. She had planned on going back to the industry, as she had a job lined up at IBM before having me, but circumstances kept changing, and it kept getting delayed. We moved to the US in 2010 through my dad's work (also a software engineer), and due to H4 limitations, she couldn't really work. So she spent her time taking care of the house, praying, and learning whatever she could in CS. This overflow of energy is how, when I was in 4th grade, she randomly taught me fundamentals in C, jumpstarting my own love for CS. Now fast forward to my sophomore year in college, I'm grinding LeetCode for interviews, and she sees me and asks me what I'm doing. After my explanation, she asks if she could try, so I gave her the link. Recently, when I went back, I learned that she's been grinding LeetCode so hard, doing four problems a day because she has nothing better to do. She has also done random training courses and internships here and there but nothing substantial. \n\nNow she has a green card EAD but still doesn't know how to get into the industry. She keeps talking about it and wondering what she could do in the industry. Most entry-level jobs require a \"Class of 2023 Graduate\" or something similar. She's one of the most hardworking, passionate, and smart people I know, and I'm confident she'd ace any interviews thrown her way. I really want to help her. She's nearing 50, and I'm just not sure what to do. She has been there for the ups and downs of our family and always stood by us helping us in whatever way she can. If anyone has similar experiences or any suggestions, I'm all ears! Pay isn't really an issue, she just wants to work and solve problems. \n\nTLDR - My mom gave up her career and passions for my brother and my success and I want to help her fulfill her dream: get back into the industry as a software engineer.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSorry for the longer post just wanted to get it all out :')", "score": 0}, {"text": "New Job Tips for Senior Eng?.

Hey folks,  \n\n\nY'all ever heard of Revature? I believe it is pretty notorious in this place. I started with them a year ago, got a client (FINRA), and things have been pretty smooth. Worked on two Projects. My first lasted 6 months and I developed a large automated end-to-end testing suite (basically alone) for an Enterprise-Wide Help Desk application. When that finished, I got a position as an SDET. I basically spend all day in meetings talking to Developers, running manual QA Tests, writing documentation, and making test plans for larger projects than executing them in tandem with Dev. Currently developing a Regression Suite using Integration Testing to hit the hundreds of endpoints we need to have covered for one of the bigger teams I work with.\n\nIt feels pretty serious. Like I work with about 15 different teams and have to keep track of everything they do. Management wanted me to develop a testing strategy for a multi-million-dollar SaaS Product in January and February. It was very stressful and required an absurd amount of coordination; especially presenting my end results to a Zoom Room full of Directors. It was difficult and, overall, great experience. Thought I made myself invaluable and that it would pay off.\n\nAnd I know I did because they were talking about converting me after that. But once the conversations started happening they realized I don't have a BS degree. In fact, I only have an AA. So now they won't convert me. I'm still supposed to finish the contract, and actually they want me to do another year on top of it. There's 0 chance I will get a full-time position though... unless I go back to school and get an applicable degree. Company policy, supposedly...\n\nSo, I brought it up with Revature... they said they'll be terminating my position with FINRA (whenever they get around to it) and I will need to do another year with a different client for less pay and then I can think about getting converted again.\n\nOverall, I feel like I am getting screwed. By both Revature and FINRA. Revature signed me up for a client that wasn't going to ever convert me (which I believe is actually a breach of my contract) and FINRA wants to use my cheap labor for as long as possible. I make 55k right now, which doesn't seem proper for the stuff they are having me do. I knew the pay would be below market standards, it's part of the contract, but talking to other people in similar positions with less than 1 year experience and the level of responsibility is straight up not comparable.\n\nWhat's the best course of action? My contract with FINRA is supposed to end in June. I'm not interested in doing another round with them. Conversion would be cool though. Having a solid year with a pretty distinguished company seems like a great thing to have on a resume, but the whole feeling of getting used is putting a horrible taste in my mouth... Breaking off with Revature probably won't be a big deal. Yeah, they have a termination clause and fee, but also, they didn't fulfill their end of the bargain. Sold me on one year experience = conversion, which although not an outright lie, was not truthful because no one did their homework on my credentials (which I never lied about or hid) before sending me out.   \n*Sidenote: Revature advertises 2 years, however that is not what I was told. I was top of the class and SCRUM Master for the final Project, so they made me different promises at the end and even gave me a $10k raise on the first day with my client because of my performance in the program and dedication to helping others succeed.*\n\nShould I start looking for other positions?

I plan on starting college in the summer. I'm 23 and in South FL  now. This will be a long post, just a heads up. I'd say this is one of  those passion vs opportunity debates with myself, but I'm passionate  about both fields.\n\n**General interests**\n\nI will start by saying that I find software very interesting. I think  many fields of CS are interesting; robotics, cybersecurity, video game  development, AI, and networking are the ones I'm interested in the most.\n\nHowever, I find the fields of EE interesting too, perhaps a bit more than those  of CS; power and energy, telecommunications, controls, nanotechnology,  also robotics, etc... I find essentially all the fields of electrical  engineering interesting, as opposed to only some from computer science.  This lack of interest in some of those CS fields is notably due to my  lack of information in regard to what they teach. I am still learning  and conducting research about what algorithms, data structures, computer  architecture, etc. consist of. It all seems almost as interesting so  far.\n\nNow, going off that alone, it  would make sense to say that I should just go for EE since I seem to  like more fields of it than CS and have a stronger interest in them in  general, but I start to have my doubts on whether it's worth it when I  hear so many people say that it's difficult to find jobs for example,  unless you are in a certain geographical location. South FL apparently  doesn't have many opportunities for EEs from what I've heard, and what  little research I've done for that. I'll leave a link for this as well.  Now I *am* willing to relocate,  but I think having that as an option and not a necessity would be better  on the nerves. Relocating isn't easy you know.\n\nWith CS, jobs are everywhere, *and*  I wouldn't have to worry about my location because I could work  remotely (I'm sure I could as an engineer, but I think it's a lot less  likely) ...\n\n**Outlook**\n\nAnother  thing I'd like to point out is that I've read articles and forums that  have discussed the future of EE that have also said that it isn't  growing. I will link them towards the end.\n\n**Actual work**\n\nWhile  I don't think I'd enjoy learning what I would in CS nearly as much as I  would in EE, I can\u2019t say for sure because I\u2019m not too familiar with CS  subjects. I *do* know that I'd  feel awful about not learning about electromagnetism and other cool  physics. On the other hand, I'd also feel bad about not learning some  cool cybersecurity, networking, or AI related topics taught in CS.\n\nHonestly, I don't *think* I'd enjoy coding all day as a job either. I **love**  coding, but I think I'd rather do it on my own free time, along with  cybersecurity, networking projects, and video game making. I've never  had to code or do these things for 8 hours a day, so how would I know?  This is a similar mindset to not knowing whether or not I'll enjoy CS  curriculum and work can be said for EE work as well. I've never had to  design, develop, and test electrical equipment before.\n\nIf  I don't end up picking EE, I'll likely reluctantly choose CS, but then I  may end up loving those fields that I'm unfamiliar with in CS just as  much as the EE ones... I just don't know... I'm sorry, as you can see  this is really stressing me out and I'd just like some help please. I am  not fond of uncertainty and I'm often indecisive as such. If you are  still reading all of this, then I really appreciate you!\n\nMy  plan at the moment is to just go for computer engineering (CPE)  actually, and just see which classes/subjects I like from there, since  I'm told often that it is a good mix between CS and EE. The only reason I  wouldn't choose CPE to completely major in is that I have heard that it  is better to specialize in one over the other, than to be a jack of all  trades. I do think CPE is cool by itself though, so I *may*  end up sticking with it the whole time. I also feel like I may \"miss  out\" on some classes that CS or EE would teach that go into more depth  and detail that CPE wouldn't...\n\nIf all else fails, I'm becoming an electrician or carpenter. I can't deal with this mess of stress, lol.\n\nThat is the end of my stress rant. I hope you all have a wonderful, amazing, and fulfilling year.\n\n**Related links**:\n\n(Please mind the clickbait headlines)\n\n\"Electrical Engineering is dead; long live the past?\"\n\n[https://lateblt.livejournal.com/325098.html](https://lateblt.livejournal.com/325098.html)\n\n\"U.S. predicts zero job growth for electrical engineers.\"\n\n[https://www.computerworld.com/article/3017196/u-s-predicts-zero-job-growth-for-electronics-engineers.html](https://www.computerworld.com/article/3017196/u-s-predicts-zero-job-growth-for-electronics-engineers.html)\n\n\u201cEngineers: Employment, pay, and outlook.\u201d\n\n[https://www.bls.gov/careeroutlook/2018/article/engineers.htm](https://www.bls.gov/careeroutlook/2018/article/engineers.htm)\n\n\u201cOccupational Outlook Handbook: Electrical Engineers\u201d\n\n[https://www.bls.gov/ooh/architecture-and-engineering/electrical-and-electronics-engineers.htm](https://www.bls.gov/ooh/architecture-and-engineering/electrical-and-electronics-engineers.htm)\n\n\"State map data for Electrical Engineers\" (Site updated February 21, 2023)\n\n[https://www.mynextmove.org/profile/state/17-2071.00?from=profile](https://www.mynextmove.org/profile/state/17-2071.00?from=profile)\n\n\"Electronics and Electrical Engineering Jobs on the Decline\u2014Can They Be Saved?\"\n\n[https://www.electronicdesign.com/technologies/embedded-revolution/article/21255051/electronic-design-electronics-and-electrical-engineering-jobs-on-the-declinecan-they-be-saved](https://www.electronicdesign.com/technologies/embedded-revolution/article/21255051/electronic-design-electronics-and-electrical-engineering-jobs-on-the-declinecan-they-be-saved)\n\n**Final thoughts**\n\nMaybe EE *is*  declining, but it could be only temporary, maybe it will jump in demand  in the future. Just like this CS \"bubble\" could only be a temporary  thing; although I think it's easier to see how CS careers such as AI,  cybersecurity, and software development will continue to grow in the  future, with the increase in tech and computers everywhere.\n\nI  think the same thing is being said about CS, about it becoming more  difficult to find work, because of AI; it\u2019s already making art, music,  and small programs, and many other things. It\u2019s only a matter of time  before it starts doing more complex things, and people are afraid of  losing their value.\n\nWith CS  though, again, it's easier to see why it's likely going to continue to  be in demand, with the rise of cyber threats, internet of things (IoT),  cloud computing, data science, etc., and you still need people to  understand the AI and its work.\n\nIt  does make sense to say from a general perspective that EEs will be  needed as well for future robotics, green/sustainable energy solutions,  biomedical engineering, etc.\n\nHowever,  while there are many people that claim that EE is still, or will be,  in-demand in the future, I've yet to see any compelling evidence or  points brought up as such.

In short, yes it will affect your programming job. Here's a link to the paper: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.10130.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.10130.pdf)\n\nI read a chunk of it but not all of it and had GPT-4 summarize the rest of it for me, so take what I say with a grain of salt. I could be wrong with my analysis so please don't take my opinion as if its fact.\n\nIt lists that areas that will be influenced most are programmers and writers, and areas that will be influenced least will be science and critical thinking. My take away from this is that jobs that are pure coding (unfortunately a lot of junior jobs) will be the ones most affected. The act of coding itself will become even more a means to an end and will be an even less important part of the job. I like to think that generative AI will soon act more as a compiler that makes your explicit natural language instructions into code that can be used by the computer. Because of that, I do see jobs that exist purely to do repetitive coding tasks will soon be taken over by LLMs.\n\nOn the flip of that, in my view actual software engineer jobs that require critical thinking aren't going away any time soon. LLMs are the best when given very explicit instructions on what to build. Ambiguity will always be a sure way to never get what you want out of the AI. Because of that, knowing things like explicit business requirements and executing those requirements in creative and imaginative ways is where the field is going. For most of you this is already your job. Like what's been said a ton by experts already, AI tools are just gonna make your existing jobs easier.\n\nHere's GPT-4's summary of paper:  \n\n\n&gt;This working paper examines the potential impact of large language models (LLMs), such as GPT-4, on the labor market. The authors investigate whether LLMs demonstrate the characteristics of general-purpose technologies (GPTs), which are rare, pervasive, and tend to improve over time with significant co-invention and spillovers.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Using a task evaluation approach with both human and GPT-4 annotations, the study finds that LLMs have the potential to significantly affect a diverse range of occupations in the U.S. economy, displaying a key attribute of GPTs. On average, 15% of tasks within an occupation are directly exposed to LLMs, increasing to over 30% when considering partial LLM-powered software exposure and surpassing 50% when considering indirect exposure.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;The study reveals that higher wages are generally associated with increased exposure to LLMs, but there is little correlation between current employment levels and exposure. Occupations that require science and critical thinking skills are less likely to be impacted by LLMs, while occupations involving programming and writing skills are more susceptible to LLM influence.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Additionally, the authors find that barriers to entry, such as education and on-the-job training, can play a role in determining exposure to LLMs. Higher exposure is observed in occupations with higher educational requirements, such as Bachelor's, Master's, and professional degrees. However, the relationship between exposure and education is not straightforward, as some occupations with lower educational requirements still show high exposure.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Although LLMs have the potential to affect many tasks, their impact on the labor market depends on the integration of LLM-powered software into broader systems, the development of co-inventions, and users' understanding of when and how to trust LLM outputs.", "score": 0}, {"text": "How to maximize job offers via LinkedIn.

Things have changed a little bit since then and I've become a bit more aware of certain things.\n\nFirst things first: I have requested to leave the project. The unfortunate reality is that I am the clueless senior dev that others are so often worried about, and there's no running away from the fact that one of the reasons why I lost my first job was because I'd started working less and less and lost faith in the team, which in turn led to me outright losing a lot of the knowledge I'd acquired and needing to be babysat for the simplest of tasks.

I've had a look at what would be required of me in this role for that project and I can safely say that I would not be able to fulfill these tasks, certainly not without being completely babysat. I've tried speaking to my manager about this to some extent but I just came off as being even more confused than I was in the previous thread, probably because I'm masking the fact that I don't know what I'm doing.\n\nI think it's only a matter of time before I'll find myself leaving the company one way or another, but if I was to put myself in a position where I can start to perform adequately again, how would I go about doing this? The feeling of total burnout is still very much present, but now it feels weird calling it that when so much of what I feel has gone wrong is down to the fact that I hardly have any real knowledge or experience, and that I've lost almost all of it doing completely unrelated work in a half-assed state for too long.\n\n^(Small edit: I'd originally called the \"completely unrelated work in a half-assed state\" at the end \"menial QA and testing.\" I was not in any way referring to such work in general, but rather what I myself was specifically doing.

One or 2 \"system architects\", the rest are just wasting money. Get rid of them, you don't need them.\" Mass layoffs. Huge skill gap with a select few senior software and devops engineers keeping the remaining jobs.\n4. ???: The rest, what will they do? Is there even going to be a technical job that's a \"spiritual successor\" to traditional coding, or is it all just going to be creative? Will we even need that many humans to be creative anymore?

I mean what are they going to teach me in less than a year that'll all of a sudden get me job ready right? So I went online looking for entry level roles and realized I didn't know half the shit I was seeing on there. I kept seeing software I had only ever heard of once or twice in all my uni years. It was at that point I realized i'm screwed. I have just about a year before I graduate and I have no idea how to do any of what these entry level roles are asking for. I talked to some of my friends about it and we all agreed that we were definitely not ready for the job market and with the way we were learning things, even after graduating we still wouldn't be prepared for it by just doing school work. I didn't even have any internships under my belt. Like I'd never worked a job in my entire life. It was that bad.\n\nNot too long after I met this guy in my department who started talking about coding and how nice it is and how much value you can generate with it. So I looked into it and decided I was going to try to learn to code. during your second to last semester you're required to get an internship postion related to your field which I did. Luckily, the company I worked for was still small and there wasn't a lot to do so I could spend that time coding and studying. I kept coding and learnign all the way up until I graduated and started my NYSC (A mandatory service year graduates of nigerian universities are required to take part in.). After I finished my internship I was fairly decent at web dev and the guy that got me started coding told me abou this business idea he had that he wanted me to build. I thought it was a decent idea and I felt it was an oppotunity to learn so I decided to start building the web app and continued working on it till we graduated and started NYSC. for the NYSC sevice year, you can either work in a place teh government will provide for you (which will most lilkely be a teaching position in a school somewhere) or you can get a letter from a company willing to take you for that year and you can work there instead.

I had no idea how to do anything in wordpress but I accepted the offer any way cuz I felt I could learn on the job and it was compltetly remote So I could work for that job while also working in quality assurance at the cable company.

Not too long after someone from the startup talked to me about a side gig we could work on. Just basic html and css for someone for quick cash outside of what I was doing for the company. I was reluctant because I was barely surviving juggling everything at the same time but He kept insisting it'd be easy and I could handle it so I accepted. Now I had stuff to do for the startup, my friends webapp and also this side project and the wire and cable company. It was a lot. Luckily, the things I had to do on the wordpress site ramped down after a while and I was only really working for the three places at once. It was still too demanding.

A little about me - I\u2019m a software engineer with 5 YOE (in 2 months time anyways) at NYC hedge funds. I\u2019ve worked for two different hedge funds so far in my career (after getting my BS in computer science) and would like to believe myself to be a detail oriented developer with knowledge in many different domains - I\u2019ve done C++ coding for some low level trading simulations, I\u2019ve done python and Java for everything and anything from scripting to microservices to writing frameworks used for something specifically at the company, I\u2019ve also done React and can easily pickup UI work. I can also easily pickup any language or framework out there as this is what do often for fun my free time, I\u2019m learning new things..\n\nSo let the rant begin, three parts:\n\n1. Just interviewed at this other company a few days back and while I never liked the interview process for software engineers in general, this really annoyed me for some reason - 40 minute interview where you have 20 minutes to basically talk about your life story, everything you\u2019ve done at previous jobs, a walkthrough of everything you know and is on your resume, basically your skillset. Then another 20 minutes where you\u2019re casually given this optimization problem to solve and code that basically can only be solved nicely with dynamic programming otherwise it\u2019s a mess of a solution. And in the meantime you\u2019re nervous, you\u2019re trying your best, you\u2019re trying to communicate with your interviewer, but they\u2019re not even engaging with you. I did present a solution and coded it for the most part, but didn\u2019t have enough time for just 20 minutes.. Why asking me these dynamic programming questions when I\u2019m already with 5 YOE and I know for a fact I\u2019ll go to the job and do something completely different since I\u2019ve been doing this for five years now and I\u2019ve never had to solve a dynamic programming question at my job. (Don\u2019t get me wrong, Id love to have a job where I do more of these more logical tasks and get better at them, but unfortunately I haven\u2019t had this chance in my career so far and I know 98% of jobs out there don\u2019t even require this). And the most annoying part of it all? I actually interviewed at same company a year ago and got an offer from them from a different team where during the interview process they did not ask these dynamic programming questions, the technical interviews were basically a discussion of what I\u2019ve done in the past, why use this tech instead of the other, some more involved questions like threading, garbage collection, etc. I showed I\u2019m competent and know what I\u2019m talking about and got the offer..\n\n2. Every recruiter that contacts me offers me other roles specifically in finance.. While this is my main experience in my career, my skills are very easily transferable to basically any other tech company out there. I am starting to get tired of finance and it is too corporate for me in general. It was never my intent to get into finance either, I just got into this field since I graduated college in the tri state area and there were a lot of opportunities in this field in this area. But now I\u2019m ready to move out there and explore, I don\u2019t understand why recruiters don\u2019t understand that.. Even when I ask for roles outside of finance, I don\u2019t get much else other than other hedge funds.. I\u2019m still in my 20s so picking something new is totally no big deal for me, that\u2019s what I\u2019m actually looking for.\n\n3. I don\u2019t understand when a job requires 5-10 YOE and also 20 different skills and they\u2019re being extremely pushy over it.. Like you\u2019re either never finding a good candidate for that position ever, or you\u2019ll always find incompetent people and have a high turnover for that position. You have to be willing to train your employees or give them time to learn.. this is an ever evolving ever-changing field, I\u2019m constantly learning, you can\u2019t expect one to know everything..\n\nTo conclude, thanks for reading and listening. I guess I\u2019m a little bummed at the industry right now. I\u2019m looking to get out of finance, but I feel like I\u2019m lacking the right connections. Also, the interview process is broken in my opinion, good candidates are being tossed away because they\u2019re human and not AI engines to code optimal dynamic programming solutions in 10-15 minutes in an interview for a job where you\u2019ll never actually use that at the job.. oh and if anyone wonders since I see this in a lot of other posts, I have a green card so immigration is not a concern for me.", "score": 2}, {"text": "How do I move on from IT helpdesk/support to QA?.

What's it like?", "score": 4}, {"text": "Very Valuable Advice I found on Blind to Cope Up the Layoffs. \"As an engineer who has been through this way too many times, I'll try to give a real answer:\n\n1. Do your job to the best of your ability because its what you are a professional. To be in upper management you have to know how to play politics, to be an engineer you have to actually understand your trade. Do your best so you can look yourself in the mirror and know your worth isn't what a bean counter says it is. Its about self-respect. and if you end up laid off or even PIPed, you can hold your head high. That confidence will move you to the front of the line for the interviews to come.\n\n2. Keep records of what you do. Once a month update your resume. Stand back and look at what you did in a way that will stand out when interviewing. Don't wait until after you are locked out - write it down now while you can review your own work.\n\n3. Listen to your teammates - are they allies or adversaries? Are their review comments helpful or building a case against you in the next ranking. Not everyone is your friend and not everyone is your enemy. Always treat both with respect, but don't be na\u00efve. Quickly discovering who is on your side is the number one thing you can do to protect yourself when politics are played.\n\n4. Talk to your manager, regularly. Never assume they know what you are doing even if they are in stand up. Get yourself on their calendar at least every other week. Make your work visible to them, document it every week. If they like you, it will be used to defend you. If they hate you, they will let you know where you stand earlier.\n\n5. Be visible to your skip level and to other team leads This protects you if your manager isn't liked. I've seen way too many great engineers suffer because of a manager that wasn't liked by their boss.\n\n6. Pay attention in all hands - not the pre-prepared, highly sanitized slides but listen careful for how they respond to questions. Management are employees too - they have been told what they cannot share but they will slip up. Micro-mistakes usually. Chat with a least one co-worker about what you heard, they will hear something different.\n\n7. Watch how your company (all companies actually) treats its employees in bad times - take note of the companies that violate their principles when things get hard. Watch which ones do rolling layoffs, forced URA, prefer hiring over promoting. Do they offer remote and then demand RTO? Take note of this - its indicates a company that doesn't respect you.\n\n8. Watch what the CEO does - does he play follow the leader? Is he afraid of making announcements? Does he hold all-hands and then announce a controversial policy the next day? Take note of this - these are weak leaders and forecasts more of the same in the future.\n\n9. Remember, if you are laid off - its never your fault. I know this seems like an obvious thing, but your mind goes there and will stay there. Layoffs are always mistakes made by upper management - they over hired, they tried to market something that wasn't selling, or they just want their stock options to go up. If you do #1, then don't blame yourself - you did your job. If you did 2-5 you did everything you could to protect yourself. If you did 6-8 you knew it was coming.\n\n10. Finally, and most importantly, make sure you spend time every day becoming better - do a LC problem, update your resume, spend 30 minutes learning something that will get your next job.

Maybe not a good comparison, as I think they\u2019d value them for different reasons and in different ways. \n\nI feel like a lot of the projects people are told to make, the ones on frontend mentor and so forth, are so common that companies wouldn\u2019t be able to know whether you just copied someone\u2019s repo. \n\nI honestly have no interest in doing anything else project-wise and I hope they won\u2019t see me as less serious or something because I haven\u2019t specifically demonstrated my ability to do the conventional side projects.\n\nI want to make a game that would involve ML (kind of an interactive ML experience toy as much as it\u2019s a game, so it\u2019s a major element) and some really impressive 3D visuals (abstract, exhibiting the ML functionality), so I figure they\u2019d assume that I\u2019m capable and well-rounded. \n\nI want to make the engine myself to learn graphics, anything to emphasize or definitely include? I can talk a lot about that and the ML stuff during interviews. If I can get people to play the game, I can talk about revisions based on feedback. \n\nI could also do multiplayer as that would surely be more technically impressive and interesting.\n\nHave you made a game? Seems like a great experience with a lot of different types of work needed.", "score": 6}, {"text": "What is your fallback for when AI takes away most of the software engineering jobs?.
