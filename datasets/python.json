We\u2019re Leo and Mandeep, founders of Datapane (https://github.com/datapane/datapane)\n\nWe're building an open-source app development platform specifically focused on Python data ecosystem. Today Datapane lets you build reports, dashboards, and full-stack apps in ~10 lines of Python, but our goal is to provide all the tools developers need to create internal data products (such as scheduled tasks, auth, integrations, OLAP) in a single simple, standardized framework. \n\nThrough our own experience building full-stack data science products for clients at our last startup, we realized that creating and deploying analytics products required a bunch of complex moving pieces, e.g. a front-end UI framework, backend server + REST/GraphQL, scheduled tasks, backend workers, caching, integrations into Slack/email, scheduled reports, and often a data layer for OLAP \u2013 the list goes on! Unsurprisingly, many companies opt to buy from external vendors instead of building in-house analytics products using Python, as this usually requires months of development time and multiple teams.\n\nWe set out to build a unified app framework which provides all the necessary parts of an internal data product, in a simple, Pythonic package. We started by building a Python-based UI framework for constructing HTML views from data-centric blocks \u2013 like plots, data tables, and layout components. You can export these to standalone HTML files, or host them as a web app on somewhere like GitHub Pages or Fly.io. \n\nNext, we added the ability to build data web apps by connecting Python functions to forms and front-end events. We handle the entire network and RPC layer, so you only need to write plain Python functions that take parameters and return other blocks. You can check out an example of the code to create a simple app: https://github.com/datapane/examples/blob/main/apps/iris-plotter/app.py \n\nCurrently, we\u2019re adding support for background tasks, scheduled tasks, and a DuckDB-based data layer for OLAP. We would love to hear from you what you find difficult about building data products so we can prioritize. \n\nOn the technical side, we wanted to keep things simple, but avoid the footguns our users faced with frameworks like Streamlit, where the reactive/network-aware model was hard to move beyond an MVP or POC. For backend interactivity, we believe the original web got a lot right, and unlike reactive models which rely on websockets, Datapane is unashamedly request/response. This takes inspiration from HTTP and our own experiences with htmx, which offers an elegant way to add interactivity to HTML. Under the hood, we actually compile down to a (gasp!) XML-based hypermedia format, akin to HTML, but tailored specifically for constructing data UIs.\n\nWe\u2019d love to hear your feedback and any questions.\n\nYou can see a few apps we\u2019ve built already in [our gallery](https://datapane.com/gallery), or get started [here](https://docs.datapane.com/quickstart/).", "score": 23}, {"text": "A countdown timer in your terminal.

This is useful for generating more coherent and on-topic responses based on your tags.\n\n\ud83d\udce6 **PyPI Deployment**: gptty is now available on PyPI, making it super easy to install and get started with just a simple `pip install gptty`.\n\n**Why should developers choose gptty?**\n\n\ud83c\udfaf **Focus on Delivered Value**: gptty is designed to help developers, data scientists, and anyone interested in leveraging ChatGPT to get the most value out of the API, thanks to context preservation, command-line integration, and new query feature.\n\n\ud83d\udee0\ufe0f **Ease of Use &amp; Flexibility**: gptty offers an intuitive command-line interface (running [click](https://click.palletsprojects.com/en/8.1.x/) under the hood), making it simple to interact with ChatGPT, either for quick one-off questions or more complex, context-driven interactions. Plus, it can be easily integrated into your existing workflows or automation scripts.\n\n[\ud83d\udcaa](https://emojipedia.org/emoji/%F0%9F%92%AA/) **Localize Chat History**: gptty stores your conversation history in a local output file, which is structured as a CSV. This means that you can still access past conversations, even when the ChatGPT web client is down, and you have more flexibility over how to select from that data to seed future queries.\n\n\ud83e\udde0 **Harness the Power of ChatGPT**: By combining the capabilities of ChatGPT with gptty's context-preserving features and query support, you can unlock a wide range of applications, from answering technical questions to generating code snippets, and so much more.\n\n\ud83d\udd00 **Support for All Completion Models**: gptty currently supports all [Completion models](https://platform.openai.com/docs/models/model-endpoint-compatibility), providing developers with the flexibility to choose the model that best suits their specific use case or application. This ensures that you can make the most of the OpenAI API and its various models without having to switch between different tools.\n\n\ud83d\udd0c **Planned Plug-and-Play Support for ChatCompletion Models**: We're working on adding plug-and-play support for [ChatCompletion models](https://platform.openai.com/docs/models/model-endpoint-compatibility) (including GPT-4 and GPT-3.5-turbo). This means that you'll be able to seamlessly integrate GPT-4 into your gptty setup and continue leveraging the power of the latest generation of language models.\n\nTo get started, simply install gptty using `pip`:\n\n    pip install gptty\n\nCheck out the **GitHub repo** for detailed documentation and examples on how to make the most of gptty: [https://github.com/signebedi/gptty/](https://github.com/signebedi/gptty/).

Github: [https://github.com/v-ko/pamet](https://github.com/v-ko/pamet)\n\n  \nThere's a gazillion note taking apps, I know, but when I started the project - there was none with the GUI I imagined. Currently Miro is pretty close, but it's closed source and it's not possible to keep your data locally, so that's the main reason I continued developing Pamet.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Demo](https://i.redd.it/m0fwjov3j4qa1.gif)\n\n# A bit of history\n\nI couple of years ago I began rewriting the app from C++/Qt to Python/Qt (PySide6). I started out with over-engineering and over-thinking it, drowning in the cross-platform-GUI swamp of technologies and so on. In the end I decided I'll use mainly Python (since I use it for work and also I love the syntax). I would try to be noobishly DRY and the reuse the actions/states with Brython in the browser and then Cordova for mobile (sounds like a great debugging experience right?).\n\nSo some time passed, I stripped my gui-architecture ambitions to a state manager ([Fusion](https://github.com/v-ko/fusion)) and finished the initial version of the app.\n\nIn retrospect - I should've done the standard thing nowadays - make a web frontend (e.g. React) with an Electron desktop app and whatever for mobile. I'll probably transition in that direction in time. But for now - I'm happy with the results.\n\n# Capabilities and philosophy\n\n(\"Pamet\" means memory in Bulgarian.)The main idea is to have 2D map-like pages (pan, zoom navigation) with notes, that can be made and styled fast. There's hyperlinking between different pages. There's a backup service by default (though restoring backups is manual for now). You can import images (audio, video - not yet implemented). You can have web links as notes, as well as activate scripts (open by double-click). Most of the testing is done on Linux. The Windows build is outdated ATM, so I'd recommend a PyPI install.\n\nI have yet to showcase the way I'm using the app, but I beilieve that everyone makes their own pattern  in time. The 2d plane + hyperlinking GUI is the UI closest to the way I connect concepts in my mind, and organize clusters of them.\n\nPamet is not supposed to be a do-it-all program, but rather it should serve for organizing ideas, \"second-brain\" is fitting buzzword right now. But it won't try to be a spreadsheet editor, image editor, specialized kanban, etc. For example right now you can import images, but editing them is done by double-clicking them to open the file, and then using whatever software you have. So the point is to keep references and possibly previews of external resources, but integrate with the existing tools, rather than reinvent the wheel.\n\n# I'd appreciate feedback\n\nThe project is still quite immature. I've been using it daily for quite a while now, but I realize that my habits are a niche, so I don't expect it would be applicable for everyone. I'd be thankful for any and all constructive feedback. About the interface, about the code, about what similar software you're using, etc.\n\n# Still this is not exactly a release\n\nI wouldn't dub this post a release, since there's quite some more work to be done.

The new are from today, not a year ago.\n\nHello fellow Pythoneers, \nit's time for me to once more talk about Starlite for a bit!\n\n## Recap\n\nWhat's Starlite?\n\nStarlite is a flexible and highly performant ASGI framework, focused on building APIs\nwhile delivering great developer experience by offering ready-built solutions for \ncommon tasks such as ORM integration, caching, session management, key/value stores,\nOpenAPI-schema generation and interactive API docs, type safety and much more.\n\nYou can read more about Starlite's features in our [documentation](https://docs.starliteproject.dev)!\n\nSo what's new?\n\n\n## Starlite 2.0 on the horizon\n\nIt's been over two months since \n[we announced](https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/108aq5b/starlite_development_updates_january_23/)\nStarlite `2.0`, more as a side note than major news, so it's about time to see how \nthings are going!\n\nFirstly, as with any proper project, there has been a *slight* feature creep, and\nthe `2.0` update will be a bit more involved as initially expected. But we have it under\ncontrol. We can stop at any time. I promise.\n\nJokes aside, the announcement still holds true: Starlite 2.0 retains most of its core \nfunctionality, and from a user perspective, not a lot has to change when upgrading \nyour app from `1.x` to `2.0`; If you don't want to make use of new features, the upgrade\npath will mostly consist of changing some import paths and slightly adjusting a few \nconfiguration values. \n\nBut let's take a look at what has changed, and what is yet to come.\n\n\n## Adieu Pydantic\n\nStarting with the release of `2.0.0alpha1`, Starlite replaced most of its internal models\nthat relied on Pydantic (mostly with data- or plain classes). In the following releases\nleading up to `2.0`, we will remove the last dependencies on Pydantic, and you can\nuse Starlite completely Pydantic-free.\n\nBut why?\n\nThe main motivations behind this were performance improvements and flexibility:\n\n\n**Performance**\n\nPydantic is a great library, but being fast is not one of its strengths. Its performance \nwill likely increase drastically in version 2.0, with the \n[core validation logic written in Rust](https://docs.pydantic.dev/blog/pydantic-v2/#performance), \nbut early tests indicate that it will likely still be slower than other libraries when \nit comes to (de)serialization. \n\nIn many cases this might not be an issue, but having the option to switch to an \nalternative if desired is still a valuable option, and can have significant impact on\nthe overall performance of an application.\n\n\n**Flexibility**\n\nPydantic is by far not the only library of its kind, with prominent members of the \nsame class being [attrs](https://www.attrs.org/), [cattrs](https://catt.rs/) or even \nplain [dataclasses](https://docs.python.org/3/library/dataclasses.html) for some use \ncases. \n\nStarlite currently only supports modelling data with Pydantic, which means this will\nnecessarily force an integration of Pydantic into the rest of the application's layers,\nbe it by directly using Pydantic models there, or simply the need of an additional\n\"translation layer\".\n\nBy removing Starlite's reliance on Pydantic, we're opening doors to a new, more \nflexible type of integration, which will ultimately allow to plugin in arbitrary\nmodelling libraries.\n\n\n**Does this mean I won't be able to use Starlite with Pydantic anymore?**\n\nNo. Starlite will continue to support Pydantic modelling of any kind, and you'll be able\nto keep using Pydantic models everywhere you've used them before. \n\nPydantic will be removed as a core dependency eventually, which means Starlite will be\nable to run without it, but there are no plans to stop supporting it.\n\n\n## All new DTOs\n\n[DTOs](https://docs.starliteproject.dev/1/usage/dto.html) will become more integral in \nStarlite 2.0, taking care of most of the data conversion between various types of models.\n\nThis feature is yet to be released, but it will allow you to seamlessly use data modelled\nwith for example Pydantic, [SQLAlchemy](https://www.sqlalchemy.org/), \n[msgspec](https://jcristharif.com/msgspec/) or \n[dataclasses](https://docs.python.org/3/library/dataclasses.html) in your route handlers,\nwithout the need for an intermediary model; The conversion will be handled by the specific\nDTO \"backend\" implementation. This new paradigm also makes it trivial to add support for \nany such modelling library, by simply implementing an appropriate backend.\n\n\n## emit(\"We have an event bus now\")\n\nStarting with the first alpha release  - `2.0.0alpha1` -, Starlite includes a simple\nevent bus that can be used to emit and receive events, supporting both synchronous\nand asynchronous listeners. Currently only a basic in-memory, per-process backend is \nincluded, but future versions will add support for inter-process communication by\nadding backends for [Redis](https://redis.io/), [RabbitMQ](https://www.rabbitmq.com/) and \nothers.\n\nThis is an exciting new feature, as it allows powerful patterns such as websocket \nbroadcasting, or can, in combination with \n[background tasks](https://docs.starliteproject.dev/1/usage/responses.html#background-tasks), \neliminate the need for external task queues such as [celery](https://docs.celeryq.dev/)\nor [arq](https://arq-docs.helpmanual.io/).\n\n\n## Data stores\n\nAnother exciting new feature coming in 2.0 are the all new, fully integrated\n[data stores](https://docs.starliteproject.dev/2/usage/stores.html). They are simple\nkey/value stores, including backends for the file system, memory, or common key/value\ndatabases like [Redis](https://redis.io/). \n\nThese stores are managed centrally by a \n[registry](https://docs.starliteproject.dev/2/usage/stores.html#managing-stores-with-the-registry), \nproviding easy configuration, isolation and a hierarchical structure via \n[namespacing](https://docs.starliteproject.dev/2/usage/stores.html#namespacing), and \nintegration with third parties such as plugins. Via the registry it's possible to easily\naccess stores used by various built-in features such as rate-limiting or request \ncaching, making them available throughout the entire application context.\n\n\n## What else is new?\n\nTo keep this post (relatively) brief I won't mention all the changes going into `2.0`,\nso if you want to know everything that's changed until now, you can take a look at\nthe detailed [2.x changelog](https://docs.starliteproject.dev/2/release-notes/changelog.html#2.0.0alpha1-misc), \nwhich includes all the currently released changes, features (and bugfixes).\n\n\n## What's left to do\n\nThere are a few more things that have to be done before Starlite 2.0 will be released.\nYesterday the second alpha version ([`2.0.0alpha2`](https://github.com/starlite-api/starlite/releases/tag/v2.0.0alpha2)) \nhas been released, but it won't be the last development release before `2.0.0`. \n\nA few major items on the 2.0 todo-list currently are:\n\n- Finishing new DTO implementation\n- New signature modelling backend using [attrs](https://www.attrs.org/)\n- Remove the remaining parts that rely on Pydantic\n- Writing a migration guide for `1.x` &gt; `2.0`\n- Writing tutorials / prose documentation for the SQLAlchemy repository\n\nand of course lots of minor issue that need taking care of.\n\nThere is no set release date for `2.0`, but as things are currently going, I expect\none more alpha release before the first beta version comes out. At this point, no more\nbreaking changes will be introduced, allowing the beta to be tested for a while before\nit can be considered stable and ready for the final release.\n\nAnd as always, if you want to get involved or in touch, check out Starlite on [GitHub](https://github.com/starlite-api/starlite/) or [join our Discord](https://discord.gg/X3FJqy8d2j)!", "score": 181}, {"text": "my first rock paper scissors game as a python newbie (code is not that great but it works).     import random\nfrom random import *\n\n    print(\"Rock, Paper, Scissors!\")\nplayerturn = int(input(\"1 for Rock, 2 for Paper, and 3 for Scissor: \"))\n\n    if playerturn == 1:\n print(\"You Chose Rock!\")\nelif playerturn == 2:\n print(\"You Chose Paper\")\nelse:\n print(\"You Chose Scissors\")\n\n    botturn = randint(1, 3)\n\n    if botturn == 1:\n print(\"They Chose Rock!\")\nif botturn == 2:\n print(\"They chose Paper!\")\nif botturn == 3:\n print(\"They Chose Scissors!\")\n\n    if playerturn == botturn:\n print(\"Tie!\")\nif playerturn == 1 and botturn == 2:\n print(\"You Lose!\")\nif playerturn == 1 and botturn == 3:\n print(\"You Win!\")\nif playerturn == 2 and botturn == 1:\n print(\"You Win!\")\nif playerturn == 2 and botturn == 3:\n print(\"You Lose!\")\nif playerturn == 3 and botturn == 1:\n print(\"You Lose!\")\nif playerturn == 3 and botturn == 2:\n print(\"You Win!\")", "score": 0}, {"text": "I didn't like that Pandas doesn't have a .notin method, so I made it myself..

For deeper context, check out my profile for my previous post in r/it for further details. The shortened version of it is that I have a repetitive data entry process that I do for my job. \n\nIt's something I do for myself because the results actively predict where I need to be to effect the best results. My company makes deliveries of a sort to over 1000 diffrent locations across my state. Knowing what our trucks are capable of delivering let's me know the operational condition of the equipment inside. As the companies service tech, I'm searching for broken systems that need repair, so I can get a very clear heads up of the problem areas long before the customers call it in.  (Example: If we regularly make a delivery of 600# and the last two deliveries show its dropped down to 50#, there's obviously something wrong there)\n\nI have a website database where every delivery is recorded. I've created a Google sheets file that's set up with formulas to crunch all the numbers for me. All I have to do is copy that delivery data from the website to the sheet and it automaticly calculates the rest. The website takes 60 seconds at least to collect the delivery data on one delivery. I compare it to what I have in the sheet and add in the new information. In order to keep up with the deliveries, I usually try to do data entry on about 100 entries each day. This process takes at least an hour every day whether it's a work day, weekend, or vacation. I get to spend at least an hour every day doing data entry work. \n\nThe goal I'm looking to accomplish is to move my Google sheets file over to some kind of automated program that will collect the data and crunch the numbers automaticly for me. Such a program would literally give me an hour more of free time every day. So it's definitely worth it to do. \n\nSo the question is, how should I do this? Should I learn how to program and do this project myself, or does it make sense to hire someone to create the program for me, and then when I learn programming, I can take over the program. \n\nOn the one hand, either way, I plan on learning programming, so I can save money and make the program myself, it's a win for me.\n\nOn the other hand, having someone else do it for me means I get an experienced hand to do it correctly the first time without the guess work that comes with doing while learning. Additionally,  saving that hour every day gives me that much more time I could put towards learning programming myself. \n\nIf I go that route, what would be a fair charge to expect for such a project, and is there anyone who would want to take on such a project?", "score": 0}, {"text": "How to Ban 1+N in Django.

Hey everyone,\n\nI figured someone could benefit from this. I mainly use a Mac or Linux. I migrated from Windows earlier last year and haven't looked back. However, in my job as a Cloud Engineer/DevOps Engineer/WhateverTheyTellMeToBeNeer I still have to maintain some Windows servers.\n\nI'm a big terminal guy. I like being able to SSH into a server when I need a few quick things and be done. Well, SSH into Windows is possible now. However, most enterprises do not support this and you are working off of older based severs that would not even support this. This means you have to RDP into the server. I HATE RDP!!!!\n\nThis got me thinking, well, what about if you make a terminal to connect from Mac/Linux to Windows using the WinRM library in Python? I started thinking about it more, what if I used something that does it already and does it well? Ansible!!! What if you used Ansible as the backend, and created a mock terminal you could send commands through??? Winner!!!\n\nSo pywinterminal is exactly that. It is a fancy forever loop that allows you to send commands to a Windows server through a mock terminal. It maintains history and directory state. So if you send a command \"cd c:\\\\windows\\\\temp\", then the next command you sent \"dir\", it would output the the dir of \"C:\\\\windows\\\\temp\". This is still a work in progress, but it has been an absolute life saver for me.\n\nThere are limitations. if you set a variable, value is not not maintained. This is something I am looking into. HOWEVER, you can send piped commands and multiple commands like \"get-service | where name -like \\*win\\*\"  or \"mkdir c:\\\\temp; cd c:\\\\temp; dir\". It uses Ansible in the backend to send all this stuff back and forth. I may be able integrate this a bit more and have a custom playbook to keep a sort of \"variable state\". Until then it has a basic functionality.\n\nIt an open source project, and it is in an early alpha stage so their will be bugs. I have not extensively tested everything, but for general use it works.

It will run in parallel to the math-course, which has examples typeset in notebooks using numpy/sympy (but from a user perspective).\n\nFor some of the technical lines (AI, robotics, etc.) this will unfortunately be their only mandatory programming course, which mean it has to do a great deal for a lot of different students. Because of these demands, I would ideally like it to start from the absolute basics (\\*no\\* prior programming experience) and end up with basic OOP as this will be important for those who do AI later (sklearn, torch, etc.), with a minimum of deviations along the way. The course will be open source  (i.e. hosted on gitlab pages; all material available without login).\n\nI have looked for other courses for inspiration, but many other courses include additional things (CS50 from Harvard) or seem to assume to much prior knowledge: [https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/6-0001-introduction-to-computer-science-and-programming-in-python-fall-2016/](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/6-0001-introduction-to-computer-science-and-programming-in-python-fall-2016/) \n\nThe kind of course I am aiming for (obviously this is open to criticism) is one that focuses maximally on the language (primitive datatypes, functions, lists+other compound types, loops, basic oop, basics about packages), somewhat focuses on useful developer skills (what is an interpreter, how to debug code, etc.) and very minimally on everything else (no regexp, no big libraries like pandas, only basic file reading/writing, etc.).  The lab sessions will be based on editing/writing .py files in VSCode.\n\nI am hoping that some here can recommend good resources -- Ideally an open-source course which has a similar scope and a really good progression curve, or a good (concise!) book, etc. Any general advice is of course welcome, but I feel stumped by the whole 'what fit in which weeks and how much' side of things. My current outline is:\n\n1. intro, print, simple functions, algebraic operations: Basically a very few examples of python to talk over that 'we will get to'. Must assume many don't have python working yet.\n\n2. primitive types, conversions int('31'), basic functions (analogy with math). \n\n3. functions++, variables, if/else. Mention type annotation to avoid confusion.\n\n4. Reading/writing text files as 'copy paste code', string operations. String manipulation is formatted as a soft intro to lists.\n\n5. Lists, loops, tuples, functions of multiple variables. \"adfsa\".split(), \"\".join(..), etc.\n\n6. Sets, functions of mutiple output arguments, comprehension, range(), enumerate()\n\n7. dicts, more on comprehension and looping, items()\n\n8. exceptions, asesrt, packages (all just a very brief overview). This is a catch-up lecture\n\n9. classes 1 (classes, mutability)\n\n10. classes 2 (inheritance, \\_\\_add\\_\\_, etc.)\n\n11. build your own sympy 1: running example on building an alternative sympy\n\n12. build your own sympy 2: running example on building a sympy + catch-up", "score": 0}, {"text": "Alarm clock made with Python &amp; Kivy.

Each component type currently only supports a single API to start with: OpenAI's ChatGPT (paid), OpenAI's Whisper (paid), and pyttsx3 (free), respectively.\n* Using these three (for now) types of components allows the user to proof of concept more complicated chatbots, such as a Speech to Speech chatbot that you can speak directly with and hear responses from: `python -m chat_toolkit --speech-to-text --text-to-speech`\n* Users can subclass the component base classes to proof of concept currently unsupported algorithms. This is the same process I will use to add support for more algorithms. Components of the same type can be hot-swapped for each other.\n* Extensible components can be used directly for developing your own applications, not just creating a quick proof of concept in the terminal.\n\nWould appreciate any constructive and respectful feedback.\n\nEDIT:\n\n\\- formatting", "score": 2}, {"text": "Going to fail an Exam because I wasn't prepared.

With the massive increase in popularity of Python in the last 10 years, seeing the way it developed, it seems to me like it gained a lot of functionality, which comes natural in other languages, but feels a bit odd in Python.\n\nTo be more specific - albeit Python being dynamically typed, people developed countless tools to check or validate or even enforce types in compile or run time (mypy, pyre, pydantic, pyduck etc.). It feels like it goes against the nature of its loose typing.\n\nAnother example are decorators. This pattern is noticably overused by many tools adding functionality, but even the language itself - defining a \\`class\\`,\\`static\\` and \\`abstract\\` methods with decorators seems just weird and unnatural. Same thing with function overloading.  Anecdotally, it feels like comparing German to English.

Let me explain:\n\n**TL;DR** A `Venv` context manager to control `sys.path` \\+ other goodies.\n\nA few years ago, when building out the [plugin system](https://meerschaum.io/reference/plugins/writing-plugins/), I wanted each plugin (i.e. just a Python module) to be given its own virtual environment, a la `pipx`, into which the plugin's dependencies are installed. In hindsight, I may have been suffering from \"not-invented-here-syndrome\" and maybe should have used one of the 1000 other Python package management tools out there, but to be honest, I'm grateful I took the time to write it exactly how I planned on using the feature. Remember, this wasn't intended to be yet another `pip` clone but instead a controlled way to manage plugins (albeit a bit hacky).\n\nThe internals of the plugin system work something like this:\n\n    &gt;&gt;&gt; from meerschaum.utils.packages import pip_install\n    &gt;&gt;&gt; pip_install('requests', venv='foo')\n    True\n\nThis creates a new venv `foo` (stored as  `~/.config/meerschaum/venvs/foo`) and installs `requests`. Another way to invoke this is through the CLI (though this will trigger installs for other internal components):\n\n    $ mrsm install package requests --venv foo\n\nNow you can use the `Venv` context manager to activate and import from this venv without having to fuss with `sys.path`, `threading.RLock`, or anything like that:\n\n    &gt;&gt;&gt; import meerschaum as mrsm\n    &gt;&gt;&gt; with mrsm.Venv('foo'):\n    ...     import requests\n    ... \n    &gt;&gt;&gt; requests\n    &lt;module 'requests' from '/root/.config/meerschaum/venvs/foo/lib/python3.12/site-packages/requests/__init__.py'&gt;\n\nAgain, this is a supporting feature, but if there's demand for it, I've been considering separating the [venv module](https://docs.meerschaum.io/utils/venv/index.html) into its own package.\n\nI hope you found this insightful and that it contributes positively to the PEP 668 discussion!", "score": 0}, {"text": "FastAPI 0.95.0 supports and recommends Annotated \ud83d\ude80 [cross-post from r/FastAPI].

All the **examples** in the docs now include a version with `Annotated` and a version without it, for each of the specific Python versions (when there are small differences/improvements in more recent versions). There were around 23K new lines added between docs, examples, and tests. \ud83d\ude80\n\nThe key updated docs are:\n\n* Python Types Intro:\n    * [Type Hints with Metadata Annotations](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/python-types/#type-hints-with-metadata-annotations).\n* Tutorial:\n    * [Query Parameters and String Validations - Additional validation](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/query-params-str-validations/#additional-validation)\n        * [Advantages of `Annotated`](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/query-params-str-validations/#advantages-of-annotated)\n    * [Path Parameters and Numeric Validations - Order the parameters as you need, tricks](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/path-params-numeric-validations/#order-the-parameters-as-you-need-tricks)\n        * [Better with `Annotated`](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/path-params-numeric-validations/#better-with-annotated)\n    * [Dependencies - First Steps - Share `Annotated` dependencies](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/dependencies/#share-annotated-dependencies)\n\nSpecial thanks to [@nzig](https://github.com/nzig) for the core implementation and to [@adriangb](https://github.com/adriangb) for the inspiration and idea with [Xpresso](https://github.com/adriangb/xpresso)! \ud83d\ude80\n\nIt took a while to get this done as it involved several days thoroughly reviewing the core PR (impeccable job) and a couple of weeks of full-time, continuous, focused work rewriting the docs, examples, and tests.

I'd love feedback on (and contributions to) the code base.\n\n**What** `gptty` **does differently than other tools**. `gptty` adds support for tagged questions that, when used correctly, allow you to access past question context across sessions. So, for example, if you prepend a question with the `[shakespeare]` tag, then tag another question with the same, it allows you to access the prior conversation with ChatGPT -  thus largely replicating the context-preserving behavior of the web application while giving users control over how to tag and categorize these conversations.\n\n[Here is an example using the \\[shakespeare\\] tag](https://preview.redd.it/vl45x6mpdtoa1.png?width=1661&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=3ec47fd71f5308c29dedc89c15302d9efc5cfa70)\n\nFundamentally, this wrapper is focused on user control over the categorization of their conversations, but it also wants to provide an aesthetically pleasing experience. If it gains some traction, I'd like to add support for a bash runtime that allows you to send one-off questions using the same categorization logic, like: `gptty --question \"how old is the universe\" --tag \"physics\"`.\n\nThanks for any feedback, contributions, or installs you can give!", "score": 0}, {"text": "Learn Python using Minecraft.

So here it is:*\n\n# Why use classes?\n\n**My \"Ah ha!\" moment for understanding classes was understanding that a** ***class*** **creates** ***objects*** **and defines the** ***type*** **of** ***object.***\n\nTime for an example:\n\nSay that we're writing a game, and we need to define certain things about the player:\n\n    player_name = \"James\"\n    player_level = \"novice\"\n\nWe also need to keep track of the player's score:\n\n    player_score = 0\n\nWe may also need to save each of the player's moves:\n\n    player_moves = [move1, move2, move3]\n\nand now we need to be able to increase the player's score when they win some points, and to add their last move to their list of moves. We can do this with a function:\n\n    def win_points (points, move):\n        player_score += points\n        player_moves.append(move)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThat's all fine so far. We have some global variables to hold the player's data, and a function to handle the results of a win, and all without writing any classes.\n\nNow say that we need to add another player. We will need to repeat all of the above but with unique identities so that we can distinguish player\\_1 from player\\_2:\n\n    player1_name = \"&lt;name&gt;\"\n    player1_level = \"novice\"\n    player1_score = 0\n    player1_moves = [move1, move2, move3]\n    \n    player2_name = \"&lt;name&gt;\"\n    player2_level = \"novice\"\n    player2_score = 0\n    player2_moves = [move1, move2, move3]\n    \n    def win_points (player_name, points, move):\n        if player_name == player1_name:\n            player1_score += points\n            player1_moves.append(move)\n        else:\n            player2_score += points\n            playe2_moves.append(move)\n\nStill not too bad, but what if we have 4 players, or 10, or more?\n\nIt would be better if we could make some kind of generic \"player\" data structure that can be reused for as many players as we need. Fortunately we can do that in Python:\n\nWe can write a kind of \"template\" / \"blueprint\" to define all of the attributes of a generic player and define each of the functions that are relevant to a player. This \"template\" is called a \"Class\", and the class's functions are called \"methods\".\n\n    class Player():\n        def __init__(self, name):\n            \"\"\"Initialise the player's attributes.\"\"\"\n            self.name = name\n            self.level = 'novice'\n            self.score = 0\n            self.moves = []\n    \n        def win_points(self, points, move):\n            \"\"\"Update player on winning points.\"\"\"\n            self.score += points\n            self.moves.append(move)\n\nNow we can create as many players (\"player objects\") as we like as *instances* of the *Player class*.\n\nTo create a new player (a \"player object\") we need to supply the Player class with a name for the player (because the initialisation function \\_\\_init\\_\\_() has an argument \"name\" which must be supplied). So we can create multiple *Player* objects like this:\n\n    player1 = Player('James')\n    player2 = Player('Joe')\n    player3 = Player('Fred')\n\nDon't overthink the `self` arguments. The self argument just means \"the specific class object that we are working with\". For example, if we are referring to *player1*, then self means \"the player1 object\".\n\nTo run the `Player.win_points()` method (the `win_points()` function in the class `Player`) for, say player3:\n\n    player3.win_points(4, (0, 1)) # Fred wins 4 points, move is tuple (0, 1)\n\nand we can access Fred's other attributes, such as Fred's player's name, or  last move, from the Player object:\n\n    print(player3.name)  # prints \"Fred\"\n    # Get Fred's last move\n    try:\n        last_move = player3.moves[-1]\n    except IndexError:\n        print('No moves made.')\n\nUsing a Class allows us to create as many \"Player\" type objects as we like, without having to duplicate loads of code.\n\nFinally, if we look at the type of any of the players,  we see that they are instances of the class \"Player\":\n\n    print(type(player1))  # prints \"&lt;class '__main__.Player'&gt;\"\n\nI hope you found this  post useful.", "score": 812}, {"text": "What you can do in 24 hour?.

In short, it is a set of \"programs used to assist in the execution and management of programs\".\n\nAt work, the action of \"executing a program\" is not particularly difficult in most cases. Usually, you edit the command first, then throw it into the shell, or an interface/platform, and then wait for the result to come out. Will use tools like crontab to pre-schedule.\n\nWith this method, if the scale is only one or two to a dozen programs, there may be no problem, but if there are hundreds or thousands of programs, it will be difficult to manage. The reason lies in the management issues derived from \"quantity\" and \"dependency\"\n\nThese management issues include: \"What is the current state of the program?\", \"What is the sequence of program execution?\", \"If a certain program needs to be re-run, will it affect which downstream related programs?\" When the number of programs is larger, it is less likely to be managed by the engineer's memory. Even if the records are assisted by files, maintenance and searching will take time and cost.\n\nAnd because data analysis has become more and more important in recent years, the data governance issue of \"whether the program is executed correctly and on time\" has also been paid more and more attention. In order to solve these issues, I hope to implement a set of tools in this project, so that some management issues can be automated, dashboarded, and the results are presented in a visual way.\n\nMaybe this project will overlap with some ETL tools (such as: SSIS, Trinity, DataStage, Automation) in function, because ETL tools also have the function of executing and managing programs, but because I haven't found a tool that can meet the needs , so that's another reason why I decided I wanted to develop my own.\n\nI hope that users only need to maintain a work list (Excel format), and then after inputting the list into this tool, a graphical program dependency flow chart can be automatically generated. The graphical program dependency flowchart is a kind of DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph). After having a graph, many issues arise about how to operate it. I try to simplify these operations as much as possible, so that these operations and management behaviors can be easily performed only by making a setting on the graphical interface, pressing a button, and viewing a report.\n\nEveryone is welcome to use this set of tools, but the design of the tools is based on my personal previous development experience and my own imagination, so if someone thinks that it is not easy to use, inconvenient, or not flexible enough, please feel free to feed these questions back to me, so that I can use them as a reference for improvement.", "score": 18}, {"text": "\ud83d\udd22\ud83d\udc0d NumPy 1.24.0 Release: Improved Data Handling, Execution Speed, and Documentation.

It's probably not that *useful*, but I do think it's an interesting concept to explore.\n\nPython ranges work on a start/stop/step model: start at some number and then increase by the step until you reach the stopping point. Meanwhile, these ranges -- which I've named **lusbirs** \\-- are determined by a lower bound, upper bound, step, and base. Take all numbers of the form (n \\* step + base) for some integer n, and then only include the numbers that fall between the lower and upper bounds. All four combinations of inclusive/exclusive lower/upper bounds are supported. The step can be positive or negative, which determines whether the range is ascending or descending, just like built-in ranges.\n\nAs an example, consider a lusbir with an exclusive lower bound of 10, an inclusive upper bound of 30, a step of 4, and a base of 2. It would represent the list of numbers between 10 (exclusive) and 30 (inclusive) that are of the form 4n + 2, which would be the list \\[14, 18, 22, 26, 30\\].\n\nMore info about this library -- including how to actually create a lusbir in your code -- is available on the project's GitHub page.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis is my first published Python library, and I made it partially to gain experience with the process of packaging a Python project.

Quick intro: NEOs are objects that approach the Sun within a distance of max. 1.3 AU. 1.0 AU corresponds to the average distance between Earth and Sun (around 150 Million km).\n\nYou may hear sometimes of these objects in the media when an asteroid is approaching us, is having a close flyby, or is detected before it vanishes while disintegrating in the night sky, [like this one](https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-64621721).\n\n*But how many objects are out there? Where are they and how do they \"travel\" around the Sun? Are they bright? If yes, how bright? How can we compute their brightness?

It has been well over 2 years since I first introduced the database to this community, see [here](https://github.com/JerBouma/FinanceDatabase), and since then a lot changed so I felt like it is worth sharing about my package yet again and honestly, also to ask for a little bit of help.\n\nSo, within the investment universe there exists tens of thousands of companies (and even more when you include all exchanges). Identifying all of them and understanding in detail where they fit in the world is tough up to a point that it either requires you to pay a hefty fee to obtain this type of categorisation or do a massive amount of manual research. I found it a bit strange that this information was not publicly available while it is quite crucial for investment research. Therefore I got to work.\n\n**Insert the** [**FinanceDatabase**](https://github.com/JerBouma/FinanceDatabase)**.** This is a database of over 300.000 symbols (155k+ companies, 36k+ ETFs, 57k+ Funds, 3k+ Cryptocurrencies and more) that is fully categorised per country, industry, sector, category and more. It includes a package, written in Python and installable with \\`pip install financedatabase\\`, that gives access to the data with ease. You can obtain the entire dataset per asset class, search through it and filter based on specific options. Have a look at [this Notebook](https://github.com/JerBouma/FinanceDatabase/blob/main/examples.ipynb) to have an idea what it is offering.\n\nA simple example of what it does in the following:\n\n    import financedatabase as fd\n    \n    # Initialize the Equities database\n    equities = fd.Equities()\n    \n    # Obtain all data available excluding international exchanges\n    equities.select()\n\nWhich returns the following DataFrame: https://preview.redd.it/5gmiej7pbjma1.png?width=1516&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=faa84ca0e91107530f9845a5313ff79adc54ba6a\n\nBy default it hides non-US exchanges (since the ticker symbols work for most other programs) but that can be turned off with **equities.select(exclude\\_exchanges=False)** which returns 155.000 rows.\n\nThe database explicitly does not store up to date fundamental data. It tries to be as timeless as possible so that it doesn't become outdated fast. Because there are a variety of other ways, like FinancialModelingPrep, yFinance etc, to get this data there is no use in including this in the database.\n\nI've improved this database not only by increasing the amount of symbols (from 180k to 300k) but also:\n\n* Approximated the The Global Industry Classification Standard (GICS\u00ae), a standard used for sectors and industries everywhere. Note that this was approximated and therefore no actual data is collected. Furthermore, not all categories are included.\n* Updated and removed tickers that either no longer exist or had outdated information.\n* Made the package itself object orientated making data collecting and searching much more efficient and logical. (shoutout to [Colin Delahunty](https://github.com/colin99d) for the help here too)\n* The database initially featured thousands of JSON files. At the time it made sense also given my rather novice background in programming. However, a much more efficient (and manageable way) is to work with CSV files. So instead, one CSV file per asset class.\n* Due to using CSV files, it becomes **really** easy to update accordingly.\n* To make loading data itself still quick, it automatically compresses the data so that loading in data is not slowed down by using a format that is more easy to update.\n* Updated the README, Contributing Guidelines and overal documentation.\n\nSo being an open source project and trying to maintain such a database is tough to do alone. While I strongly believe the database can stay relevant for a long period due to the fact that the majority of companies do not suddenly stop existing, some maintenance is needed. Therefore, with this post I would like to not only invite you to explore the database but also to see if you can improve it along the way.

Here's my take on it:\n\nEven though, as mentioned in the original thread, Rust is not a magical solution for anything, I think the language's features that make it less prone to bugs (mainly memory safety, AFAIK) could speed up improvements to Python. This could happen directly, or indirectly by simplifying contributions to the interpreter.\n\nSince the original discussion, the Linux kernel has started taking contributions in Rust. It'll probably be a very long time before the majority of the kernel is in Rust; if it is ever fully converted that will definitively take much longer. But this movement gives Rust a strong vote of credibility, and IMO a confident step in establishing Rust as the successor of C as de facto system language of the day (again, a confident *first* step).\n\nConnecting to the point above about Rust succeeding C, the Rust community seems a lot more prolific than C's while both C and C++ [were reported](https://www.statista.com/statistics/793628/worldwide-developer-survey-most-used-languages/) as being used much more than Rust in 2022. I believe Rust has the qualities to dominate many of the areas C dominates today, but that trend has definitely not materialized yet. If there is indeed a trend of Rust growing more, and if this trend keeps up, an interpreter in Rust could eventually source from a larger pool of developers.\n\nLastly, I think the Rust and Python communities could mingle (e.g. over cherishing a good developer experience) and contribute much to each other in a way that doesn't happen with Python and C where there seems to be a wall imposing that Python is for flexibility and C for performance. This last point seems to me the most important/fruitful, but is also most subjective and sensible to my own biases.\n\nSo I'm curious about the community's feelings on this topic in general, but would also like to suggest the question: How important do you think it would be to have a mature Python interpreter written in Rust 10 years from now?", "score": 36}, {"text": "Company formed around Pydantic.

But overall the `AI_SMS.py` file can be run in the background of a raspberry pi or similar device and act as a new tool on your device.

After selecting texts which received a confidence score higher than 0.8, we plotted their coordinates as company logos on a leaflet map using Python and the folium library, restricting the map to the bounding box of the San Francisco Bay Area and Silicon Valley.\n\nWe analyzed over 300 social media posts and found that roughly 54.5% of the time, OpenAI was the most talked about.

Greetings to the Python community! Back in the summer I made a post here about [PRegEx](https://github.com/manoss96/pregex), an open source project I had made for fun, for which I received mostly positive feedback. This urged me to create [Fluke](https://github.com/manoss96/fluke), yet another open-source project, based on some issues I was having at work relating to transfering data between different cloud storage services. This project is by no means considered to be complete as I have tons of ideas regarding how it could be further expanded to tackle other issues as well. However, I think that it is now at a mature enough stage that it could help you speed up certain processes that may come up during your day-to-day work. \n\nYou can find the docs in here: [fluke.rtfd.io](https://fluke.rtfd.io/)\n\nAny feedback is welcome, and please don't hesitate to raise an issue on Github if you encounter any bugs!", "score": 49}, {"text": "How to setup Python, PyEnv &amp; Poetry on Windows.

Source: [https://github.com/freyjagp/bootleg-jwt](https://github.com/freyjagp/bootleg-jwt)\n\n\nUsing pydantic, one can easily integrate this module with any web framework for quick and simple token validation. See the readme for basic usage.\n\n\n\n\n# bootleg-jwt &lt;!-- omit in toc --&gt;\n\n`bootleg-jwt` aims to mimic JSON Web Tokens in a simple, `pydantic` way.\n\nThis module provides two main functions:\n\n- [Generate a token](#generate-a-token)\n- [Validate a token](#validate-a-token)\n\nThese are designed to be very simple to use. See below:\n\n## Generate a token\n\n```python\nfrom bootleg_jwt import BootlegJWT, Payload, header, body\nfrom pydantic import BaseModel\nfrom os import environ              # An environment variable is required.\n\n\nSECRET = \"some-secret-key\"\n\n\nDURATION = 60 * 60                  # Token expires after this many seconds\n\n\nTYPE = \"Testing Token\"              # An arbitrary name\n\n\nenviron['SECRET'] = SECRET          # This module depends upon an environment\n                                    # variable `SECRET`.
